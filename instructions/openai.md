**Important:** If you're currently using OpenAI's free trial credit, your API key will be subject to much lower [rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/rate-limits), and may not be able to handle longer files (approx. 1 hour+, but the actual limit is hard to determine). 

If you're looking to work with long files, I recommend [setting up your billing info at OpenAI now](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview).

Additionally, you'll need to generate a new API key and enter it here once you enter your billing information at OpenAI; once you do that, trial keys stop working.
