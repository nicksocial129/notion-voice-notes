00:00:10.955
Speaker 0: sarahzed. Hey guys. So if you're wondering why

00:00:13.995
Speaker 0: it's been a little while since the last

00:00:16.075
Speaker 0: video, you know how life just kind of

00:00:19.310
Speaker 0: happens at you sometimes and then you kind

00:00:21.470
Speaker 0: of like realize that you're just burnt out

00:00:23.950
Speaker 0: and exhausted and just life Stuff just keeps

00:00:27.685
Speaker 0: piling on and on and on and just

00:00:29.525
Speaker 0: giving you more and more difficult things to

00:00:31.845
Speaker 0: manage in your life, and you just kind

00:00:34.325
Speaker 0: of hit a breaking point, and you just

00:00:36.790
Speaker 0: can't anymore and you're just, you're fucking burnt

00:00:40.629
Speaker 0: out about constantly producing content. Stream. So on

00:00:45.254
Speaker 0: an unrelated topic, mental health, am I right?

00:00:49.414
Speaker 0: On a completely additionally unrelated topic, Dear Evan

00:00:52.855
Speaker 0: Hansen. Stream. Wasn't a very good movie, was

00:00:54.960
Speaker 0: it? So you might have missed this since,

00:00:58.400
Speaker 0: you know, nobody else in the world was

00:01:00.160
Speaker 0: remarking on this stri- or making videos on

00:01:02.105
Speaker 0: this, but a couple months ago, the film

00:01:04.185
Speaker 0: adaptation of famous musical Dear Evan Hansen came

00:01:07.385
Speaker 0: out and it was, In fact, not very

00:01:09.880
Speaker 0: good. Not only was it just a bad

00:01:12.040
Speaker 0: translation of the Dear Evan Hansen material, but

00:01:14.280
Speaker 0: it was also just a pretty bad film

00:01:16.360
Speaker 0: in its own right. And all jokes aside,

00:01:18.795
Speaker 0: the movie has been talked about by a

00:01:20.475
Speaker 0: pretty good number of great channels that have

00:01:22.634
Speaker 0: broken down a lot of things that are

00:01:24.314
Speaker 0: just Stream. Very bad about this movie. Though,

00:01:27.460
Speaker 0: out of all of them, the sequence where

00:01:29.140
Speaker 0: the speech goes viral and the YouTube video

00:01:31.300
Speaker 0: is titled His Best Friend Just Died, You

00:01:33.860
Speaker 0: Won't stream. Believe what happens next is still

00:01:36.595
Speaker 0: my favorite. Dear Evan Hansen, for all its

00:01:39.634
Speaker 0: terribleness, isn't the only musical movie that's been

00:01:42.674
Speaker 0: in the news Stringsley. On a much more

00:01:44.410
Speaker 0: recent note, anyone interested in musicals is probably

00:01:47.130
Speaker 0: hearing a lot right now after the new

00:01:49.050
Speaker 0: casting announcement for the Wicked movie, a film

00:01:51.565
Speaker 0: Stritation that's been in development hell for ages

00:01:53.725
Speaker 0: and is, it seems, finally starting to come

00:01:56.445
Speaker 0: to fruition. Both casting decisions, both the casting

00:01:59.325
Speaker 0: of pop star Ariana Grande to play Glenda

00:02:01.550
Speaker 0: Strayer and that of Cynthia Erivo to play

00:02:03.470
Speaker 0: Elphaba have created a pretty big stir across

00:02:06.110
Speaker 0: social media, with lots of debates about things

00:02:08.750
Speaker 0: like How old the actors should be given

00:02:11.035
Speaker 0: when the characters start their story in university

00:02:13.275
Speaker 0: and whether it's okay to cast primarily pop

00:02:15.435
Speaker 0: singers even if they have A bit of

00:02:16.870
Speaker 0: theater experience in a very vocally demanding musical

00:02:19.750
Speaker 0: theater role and just generally what kind of

00:02:22.070
Speaker 0: choices you need to make while adapting a

00:02:24.070
Speaker 0: Broadway show to the screen. Dear Evan Hansen,

00:02:26.765
Speaker 0: for all its awful nature, isn't alone in

00:02:29.405
Speaker 0: its status as a very, very notoriously bad

00:02:32.765
Speaker 0: adaptation of a Broadway musical. Stri- Before you

00:02:35.480
Speaker 0: had the horrors of a graying Ben Platt

00:02:37.799
Speaker 0: trying to play a high school student and

00:02:39.560
Speaker 0: looking way too old and hunching over to

00:02:41.560
Speaker 0: look younger but actually just looking like a

00:02:43.474
Speaker 0: dog that swallowed a bee. You have the

00:02:45.795
Speaker 0: horrific CGI nightmares that were Tom Hooper's jellicle

00:02:49.315
Speaker 0: cats. And I just wanna talk about that

00:02:52.900
Speaker 0: because this somehow keeps happening. We just keep

00:02:56.340
Speaker 0: having these, like, weird trainwreck musical adaptations that

00:02:59.940
Speaker 0: are just these embarrassingly to add imitations of

00:03:02.905
Speaker 0: the stage shows. Or, possibly worse, we keep

00:03:05.545
Speaker 0: getting these adaptations that are, you know, perfectly

00:03:08.105
Speaker 0: fine visually and have impressive casts but are

00:03:11.465
Speaker 0: just St. Incredibly muted and forgettable. You have

00:03:14.730
Speaker 0: your Into the Woodses and your live action

00:03:17.210
Speaker 0: Disneys and what have you. And the fact

00:03:19.130
Speaker 0: that these Stream. Huge studios just consistently keep

00:03:22.185
Speaker 0: fucking this up is just fascinating. And, well,

00:03:25.785
Speaker 0: y'all know me. I love musicals. I love

00:03:28.330
Speaker 0: bad movies. And I love talking about adaptations.

00:03:31.610
Speaker 0: So what I really wanna do for this

00:03:33.049
Speaker 0: video is essentially break down the Dear Evan

00:03:35.450
Speaker 0: Hansen movie. Stream. What exactly didn't work about

00:03:37.925
Speaker 0: it and how each aspect of it got

00:03:40.084
Speaker 0: lost in the translation between stage and screen,

00:03:43.045
Speaker 0: and what that can tell us stress about

00:03:44.659
Speaker 0: film adaptations of musicals in general. So first

00:03:47.700
Speaker 0: of all, for those of you who haven't

00:03:49.540
Speaker 0: seen Dear Evan Hansen, What's this show's deal?

00:04:01.599
Speaker 0: So Dear Evan Hansen is a musical that

00:04:03.680
Speaker 0: swept the Broadway world when it formally released

00:04:06.239
Speaker 0: in 2015. When the show started to get

00:04:08.720
Speaker 0: popular on social media, You'd have a lot

00:04:10.694
Speaker 0: of people erroneously thinking it was about a

00:04:12.855
Speaker 0: gay kid, and then reading the actual plot

00:04:14.935
Speaker 0: summary and just fucking losing it. You know,

00:04:17.095
Speaker 0: Dear Evan Hansen kinda sounds like Love St.

00:04:19.490
Speaker 0: Simon enough that people often mix the 2

00:04:21.410
Speaker 0: up and Ben Platt is gay and it's

00:04:23.250
Speaker 0: Broadway. And there was a pretty big subsection

00:04:25.650
Speaker 0: of fandom who did do a lot of

00:04:27.410
Speaker 0: gay shipping and like, I get it. Stree-

00:04:29.395
Speaker 0: But, no. This one's straight. So, and a

00:04:32.115
Speaker 0: warning for the rest of this video, mental

00:04:34.035
Speaker 0: health and suicide are going to be referenced

00:04:36.195
Speaker 0: throughout just because that is what the Story

00:04:38.230
Speaker 0: Fundamentally is about, the show focuses on a

00:04:40.870
Speaker 0: character named Evan Hansen, or if you're RuPaul,

00:04:43.910
Speaker 0: a character named Dear.

00:04:45.675
Speaker 1: I saw dear Evan Hansen on Broadway and,

00:04:48.475
Speaker 1: Ben Platt who plays Derek. He gave everything.

00:04:52.395
Speaker 0: Evan comes from a lower middle class Family

00:04:54.760
Speaker 0: and suffers from severe anxiety, and we later

00:04:57.240
Speaker 0: learn that he had tried to take his

00:04:59.000
Speaker 0: own life a couple months before the show

00:05:00.920
Speaker 0: begins, which is the reason we see Evan's

00:05:03.080
Speaker 0: arm in a cast during the first arc.

00:05:05.305
Speaker 0: He struggles a lot with learning to interact

00:05:07.544
Speaker 0: with his peers and doesn't really have any

00:05:09.705
Speaker 0: real friends or hobbies outside being scared Strider

00:05:12.470
Speaker 0: to talk to the girl he likes, Zoe.

00:05:14.389
Speaker 0: Back at Zoe's house, her family is also

00:05:16.550
Speaker 0: dealing with a lot of dysfunction, her own

00:05:18.389
Speaker 0: brother Connor being very mentally unstable and violent.

00:05:21.205
Speaker 0: Strand. Evan has to write letters to himself

00:05:23.444
Speaker 0: as a therapy activity, and he writes this

00:05:25.284
Speaker 0: very sad one to himself that references Zoe

00:05:27.764
Speaker 0: and his own mental health Struggles and prints

00:05:29.990
Speaker 0: it out at school where it is stolen

00:05:31.830
Speaker 0: by Connor. Evan later finds out that Connor

00:05:34.470
Speaker 0: has killed himself, and Connor's Stree parents find

00:05:36.905
Speaker 0: this letter on him and erroneously believe that

00:05:39.385
Speaker 0: their son wrote the note, and Evan and

00:05:41.305
Speaker 0: Connor are their 4 best friends. Streams. He

00:05:43.930
Speaker 0: keeps trying to tell them the truth but

00:05:46.009
Speaker 0: gets strong armed and interrupted the first time

00:05:48.250
Speaker 0: and is too anxious to speak up the

00:05:50.009
Speaker 0: second Stream until he ends up going along

00:05:52.685
Speaker 0: with the lie. His family friend Jared ends

00:05:55.565
Speaker 0: up helping him fabricate email exchanges between Connor

00:05:58.849
Speaker 0: and Evan pretending they were friends, and Evan

00:06:01.410
Speaker 0: starts deceiving Connor's family, including Zoe. For a

00:06:04.690
Speaker 0: while, Evan has a really idyllic life by

00:06:07.009
Speaker 0: playing along. Stream. He gets to feel at

00:06:08.985
Speaker 0: home among this wealthy family, who are now

00:06:11.384
Speaker 0: essentially treating him as a surrogate son. He

00:06:14.104
Speaker 0: ends up dating Zooey, and he becomes Street

00:06:16.370
Speaker 0: popular at school and goes viral due to

00:06:18.370
Speaker 0: his perceived connection with the kid who died.

00:06:21.090
Speaker 0: We also see a few interactions with the

00:06:23.090
Speaker 0: character of Alana, a girl at Evan's school

00:06:25.570
Speaker 0: who is Stream. Extremely involved with extracurriculars and

00:06:28.435
Speaker 0: helps Evan set up a charity foundation in

00:06:30.914
Speaker 0: Connor's name. Her own life and struggles aren't

00:06:33.955
Speaker 0: super Street Lord, but it's pretty heavily implied

00:06:37.290
Speaker 0: that Allana is also either suicidal or just

00:06:40.090
Speaker 0: mentally ill in general, and is using her

00:06:42.410
Speaker 0: involvement in a lot of extracurriculars to to

00:06:44.745
Speaker 0: hide that fact. In any case, Evan is

00:06:47.065
Speaker 0: able to maintain the deception for a while,

00:06:49.225
Speaker 0: but ultimately he cracks under a mixture of

00:06:51.860
Speaker 0: Pressure to keep a bunch of lies going,

00:06:54.020
Speaker 0: the online abuse Connor's family is starting to

00:06:56.580
Speaker 0: receive, and his straining relationship with his own

00:06:59.220
Speaker 0: mother, and ends up confessing his deception to

00:07:01.765
Speaker 0: St. Honors parents and Zoe, who then no

00:07:03.845
Speaker 0: longer want anything to do with Evan. Eventually,

00:07:06.965
Speaker 0: he loses the benefits that he had gained

00:07:09.365
Speaker 0: from the deception, but he also starts to

00:07:11.990
Speaker 0: repair his relationship with his mother. At the

00:07:14.630
Speaker 0: end, we see a short scene of him

00:07:16.550
Speaker 0: about a year later, having taken a year

00:07:18.630
Speaker 0: off before community college Strick to work, as

00:07:21.035
Speaker 0: he talks to Zoe and the 2 of

00:07:22.794
Speaker 0: them reflect on all of what happened. The

00:07:25.915
Speaker 0: musical had been workshopped for about a year,

00:07:28.315
Speaker 0: although there weren't a Stream. There was originally

00:07:33.280
Speaker 0: a song in it called Goin' Viral that

00:07:35.200
Speaker 0: quoted social media posts Stream that apparently was

00:07:37.365
Speaker 0: reminiscent of Justin Bieber's story, which later got

00:07:40.165
Speaker 0: cut. You can find some performances of it

00:07:42.805
Speaker 0: now, and it references Stream. It also mentions

00:07:45.015
Speaker 0: some really dated stuff like the UGGs trend

00:07:47.566
Speaker 0: and Charlie bit my finger, so probably a

00:07:50.117
Speaker 0: good call. It was called The People Project

00:07:52.755
Speaker 0: at first, and Heather's Barrett Wilbert Weed was

00:07:55.155
Speaker 0: gonna be in it, but by and large

00:07:56.915
Speaker 0: the show and the rest the cast mostly

00:07:59.210
Speaker 0: remained the same throughout the readings, something that

00:08:01.690
Speaker 0: isn't super common with a lot of Broadway

00:08:04.010
Speaker 0: shows. One notable exception, which we'll get stitched

00:08:06.955
Speaker 0: on more a little later is the character

00:08:08.955
Speaker 0: of Alana, who went through a different actor

00:08:11.195
Speaker 0: at every reading. They were apparently having trouble

00:08:14.075
Speaker 0: kind of finding the voice for the character

00:08:16.270
Speaker 0: and who they wanted her to be, a

00:08:17.790
Speaker 0: problem that honestly kind of never really got

00:08:21.070
Speaker 0: resolved and shines stri- through most performances and

00:08:23.945
Speaker 0: adaptations of the show. When they started actually

00:08:26.185
Speaker 0: staging it, it didn't work for a lot

00:08:27.865
Speaker 0: of audiences, poorly enough that apparently the show's

00:08:30.345
Speaker 0: creators were close to completely shutting down the

00:08:32.830
Speaker 0: project. It's not uncommon for shows to go

00:08:35.309
Speaker 0: through changes and rewrites during their preview period,

00:08:38.110
Speaker 0: that's essentially what the whole period is 4,

00:08:40.404
Speaker 0: but the fact that it really wasn't working

00:08:42.565
Speaker 0: to that extent is interesting. The justification for

00:08:45.524
Speaker 0: making rewrites instead of Dropping the show is

00:08:48.140
Speaker 0: extremely funny though. According to Justin Paul, one

00:08:51.420
Speaker 0: of the 3 people who wrote the show,

00:08:53.740
Speaker 0: we were like, Stream. We can't do that

00:08:55.945
Speaker 0: to Ben Platt. Like, Ben Platt is like

00:08:58.905
Speaker 0: a sad little Victorian orphan they adopted and

00:09:01.545
Speaker 0: they're like, we cannot take sickly Benjamin's traveling

00:09:04.790
Speaker 0: stage show from the township, not when he

00:09:07.110
Speaker 0: is consumptive. So they kept rewriting and reworking

00:09:11.030
Speaker 0: and in the case of Alana recasting until

00:09:13.625
Speaker 0: they finally had a finished show. And this

00:09:16.345
Speaker 0: thing was a huge fucking hit. Dear Evan

00:09:19.270
Speaker 0: Hansen officially opened to a wave of positive

00:09:22.310
Speaker 0: reviews, praising it for a variety of different

00:09:25.030
Speaker 0: reasons. The inventiveness of incorporating social media and

00:09:28.715
Speaker 0: social media virality onto the show, its representation

00:09:31.835
Speaker 0: of anxiety and broader mental health Strings in

00:09:34.370
Speaker 0: general, the relationships between all of the characters,

00:09:37.730
Speaker 0: in particular, that relationship between dear Evan Hansen

00:09:40.770
Speaker 0: and his mom, and to a lesser extent,

00:09:43.245
Speaker 0: Stream. The contemporary music and the emotional resonance

00:09:46.285
Speaker 0: many people felt that it was able to

00:09:47.885
Speaker 0: create. Not only did it bring in a

00:09:50.125
Speaker 0: significant amount of praise in a variety of

00:09:52.450
Speaker 0: newspapers and in terms of attention and ticket

00:09:54.690
Speaker 0: sales, it also performed very well at the

00:09:57.330
Speaker 0: Tonys, which had the musical up against a

00:09:59.845
Speaker 0: number of other quite good shows. Dear Evan

00:10:02.644
Speaker 0: Hansen was nominated for 9 Tonys, including best

00:10:05.845
Speaker 0: musical, and won 6 of them streaking, which

00:10:09.889
Speaker 0: I'll I'll talk more about my actual feelings

00:10:11.649
Speaker 0: on the show later, but I think is

00:10:13.170
Speaker 0: pretty interesting because for all its praise, pretty

00:10:16.209
Speaker 0: much all of these shows, at least in

00:10:18.235
Speaker 0: my opinion are better than dear Evan Hansen.

00:10:21.915
Speaker 0: Like, Groundhog Day, I get not winning. It

00:10:24.315
Speaker 0: got a good 8 nominations that year Strip.

00:10:26.020
Speaker 0: It didn't really sell a lot of tickets

00:10:27.540
Speaker 0: or catch a lot of attention, and it's

00:10:29.220
Speaker 0: good but it's also not, like, an original

00:10:31.620
Speaker 0: concept. But Come From Away and especially Great

00:10:34.740
Speaker 0: Comet are just these streaming. And so to

00:10:40.404
Speaker 0: see a show about a high schooler with

00:10:42.005
Speaker 0: some fairly simple characters and a pretty basic

00:10:44.565
Speaker 0: pop soundtrack beat out Stree Others was a

00:10:47.430
Speaker 0: bit strange. At the very least, it was

00:10:49.670
Speaker 0: a testament to how popular Dear Evan Hansen

00:10:52.470
Speaker 0: had gotten. And while that popularity also comes

00:10:55.509
Speaker 0: in the form of glowing reviews from journalists

00:10:57.815
Speaker 0: and award success and general praise for its

00:11:00.215
Speaker 0: whole concept, it also gained a pretty big

00:11:02.855
Speaker 0: fandom across social media platforms that were largely

00:11:05.710
Speaker 0: popular with teens. This was especially apparent in

00:11:08.910
Speaker 0: the rise of shipping media. Be it thicks

00:11:11.470
Speaker 0: or Stream fanart or animatics, usually pairing Evan

00:11:14.644
Speaker 0: with Connor Murphy or, to a lesser but

00:11:16.964
Speaker 0: still present extent, his friend Jared. Of course,

00:11:20.140
Speaker 0: Connor and Evan only get that one very

00:11:22.220
Speaker 0: brief interaction in canon and most of the

00:11:24.459
Speaker 0: musical is just Evan pretending to have been

00:11:26.700
Speaker 0: friends with Connor, but for a lot of

00:11:29.037
Speaker 0: people, that immediately begs the question of, well,

00:11:31.461
Speaker 0: what if Evan actually had been friends with

00:11:33.885
Speaker 0: Connor? What if they ended up getting together?

00:11:36.390
Speaker 0: So you'd see a huge ton of media

00:11:38.550
Speaker 0: in that teen fandom niche either about Dear

00:11:41.350
Speaker 0: Evan Hansen or just really about Evan and

00:11:44.070
Speaker 0: Connor. Stream. Dear Evan Hansen enjoyed quite a

00:11:46.645
Speaker 0: lot of success and popularity for quite a

00:11:49.045
Speaker 0: while after its inception. But one of the

00:11:51.365
Speaker 0: things that did earn it backlash was this

00:11:54.110
Speaker 0: stream fandom that it had. This has actually

00:11:56.430
Speaker 0: been a bit of an interesting shift in

00:11:58.029
Speaker 0: broadway culture over the last 5 or 6

00:12:00.190
Speaker 0: years. Whether it's Street, increasing accessibility of bootlegs

00:12:03.365
Speaker 0: that let people watch expensive musicals for free,

00:12:05.845
Speaker 0: the growth of video sharing platforms like TikTok

00:12:08.404
Speaker 0: populated mostly by kids Stream Teens, or the

00:12:11.500
Speaker 0: late cult fandom that shows like Heather's got,

00:12:13.980
Speaker 0: there's been a huge boost recently in Broadway

00:12:16.220
Speaker 0: shows either specifically about teens or marketed toward

00:12:19.565
Speaker 0: Stream, and this has become a pretty divisive

00:12:21.805
Speaker 0: thing in the Broadway community as of late.

00:12:24.125
Speaker 0: Shows about or 14s aren't new or anything

00:12:27.165
Speaker 0: like that. Off the top of my Stread,

00:12:29.130
Speaker 0: I can think of shows like 13 or

00:12:31.290
Speaker 0: Carrie or Bear or even Bring It On

00:12:33.529
Speaker 0: that had school as their primary setting and

00:12:35.610
Speaker 0: aren't really new, but those shows were never

00:12:38.615
Speaker 0: as huge as they are today, and they

00:12:40.455
Speaker 0: tend to be far and few between compared

00:12:42.535
Speaker 0: to the more adult centric focus of Broadway.

00:12:45.334
Speaker 0: Nowadays, though, especially following the online success of

00:12:48.459
Speaker 0: a show like Heathers, which ran off broadway

00:12:50.860
Speaker 0: and didn't make huge waves when it came

00:12:52.620
Speaker 0: out but gained a massive following in 2

00:12:54.860
Speaker 0: London revivals after an illegal recording of it

00:12:57.420
Speaker 0: got popular Stream Online, this trend has really

00:13:00.365
Speaker 0: exploded. Whether it's Dear Evan Hansen or Be

00:13:03.245
Speaker 0: More Chill or Mean Girls Leave the music

00:13:05.540
Speaker 0: for so much and I am physically resisting

00:13:07.700
Speaker 0: the temptation to go off at a whole

00:13:09.220
Speaker 0: rant about or The Lightning Thief or The

00:13:11.380
Speaker 0: Prom. These stre- You shows, I guess is

00:13:14.705
Speaker 0: the right word, have blown up in their

00:13:16.625
Speaker 0: numbers and popularity recently, and with them has

00:13:19.745
Speaker 0: come divisiveness. Shows that aren't stream fully about

00:13:22.980
Speaker 0: teens but are still largely popular with and

00:13:25.620
Speaker 0: marketed at least partly to a teen audience

00:13:28.180
Speaker 0: like Beetlejuice or 6x are strolled in the

00:13:32.335
Speaker 0: wall. This divisiveness is broadly present when young

00:13:35.375
Speaker 0: people get into pretty much any new hobby

00:13:37.775
Speaker 0: ever, but usually The critiques are a mix

00:13:40.490
Speaker 0: of being frustrated with new fans not knowing

00:13:43.209
Speaker 0: how to act politely at Broadway shows, or

00:13:46.410
Speaker 0: only being interested in teen musicals, or just,

00:13:49.995
Speaker 0: like, existing in such large numbers that people

00:13:52.475
Speaker 0: feel that the genre is now pandering to

00:13:54.635
Speaker 0: them. That critique is especially paired with the

00:13:57.195
Speaker 0: fact that many of these shows are, while

00:13:59.380
Speaker 0: not necessarily bad, also very simple. Like, they're

00:14:03.860
Speaker 0: for teens. Streams. Shows like Mean Girls or

00:14:06.084
Speaker 0: Be More Chill tend to broadly feature fairly

00:14:08.725
Speaker 0: same y music that's easy to sing and

00:14:10.964
Speaker 0: not super complex, relatively simplistic straightforward lyrics and,

00:14:15.640
Speaker 0: well, teen themes. Some of the frustration, then,

00:14:18.760
Speaker 0: with the recent popularity of teen musicals is

00:14:21.080
Speaker 0: this idea that there can only really be

00:14:23.015
Speaker 0: a limited number of musicals that run on

00:14:25.175
Speaker 0: Broadway at any given time. And so many

00:14:28.055
Speaker 0: of the ones on right now and that

00:14:29.575
Speaker 0: seem to be getting made are just kind

00:14:31.495
Speaker 0: of okay and aren't super artistically interesting. At

00:14:35.339
Speaker 0: the same time, though, I dunno, more people

00:14:37.980
Speaker 0: getting into stuff and making it broadly accessible

00:14:40.695
Speaker 0: tends to generally be a net good, and

00:14:43.175
Speaker 0: when Broadway especially has had such a reputation

00:14:46.055
Speaker 0: for such a long time of being both

00:14:48.470
Speaker 0: geographically and financially inaccessible to most people, honestly,

00:14:52.190
Speaker 0: I think that anything that brings it to

00:14:54.110
Speaker 0: broader numbers is generally good. So, as much

00:14:57.525
Speaker 0: as I hate Mean Girls, count me out

00:14:59.765
Speaker 0: of the whole backlash against teen Broadway fans

00:15:02.645
Speaker 0: who only like teen Musicals thing. That being

00:15:04.720
Speaker 0: said, the teen fandom Dear Evan Hansen gained

00:15:07.600
Speaker 0: its high school subject matter and the fact

00:15:09.760
Speaker 0: that it was being Strays and winning awards

00:15:11.985
Speaker 0: over more technically impressive musicals like Great Comet

00:15:15.585
Speaker 0: earned it a fairly fast reputation for being

00:15:18.360
Speaker 0: overrated. Despite the kind of grumblings from people

00:15:22.120
Speaker 0: who don't love Dear Evan Hansen about not

00:15:24.360
Speaker 0: liking it or not getting what everyone sees

00:15:26.280
Speaker 0: in it, Strip. Its success, both of the

00:15:28.115
Speaker 0: commercial and fandom variety, continued to skyrocket. And

00:15:31.715
Speaker 0: in 2020, it was announced that the musical

00:15:33.770
Speaker 0: Strangle would get a film adaptation directed by

00:15:36.170
Speaker 0: Stephen Chbosky, the guy who wrote Perks of

00:15:38.330
Speaker 0: Being a Wallflower and directed Wonder and worked

00:15:40.730
Speaker 0: on other musical movies like Rent or live

00:15:43.205
Speaker 0: action Beauty and the Beast. Another thing on

00:15:45.525
Speaker 0: backlash to Dear Evan Hansen is that when

00:15:47.845
Speaker 0: the film adaptation got announced and started getting

00:15:50.960
Speaker 0: Stress, there started to be this weird viral

00:15:53.200
Speaker 0: response to it where people would hear about

00:15:55.120
Speaker 0: it in the news and then learn what

00:15:56.960
Speaker 0: the story is actually about. Because, y'know, a

00:16:00.395
Speaker 0: lot of people who don't know anything about

00:16:02.155
Speaker 0: the show once again assume it's a coming

00:16:04.475
Speaker 0: out story about a gay kid. I did

00:16:06.395
Speaker 0: an informal poll of this on Twitter a

00:16:08.279
Speaker 0: while back, and a lot of people think

00:16:10.360
Speaker 0: this. So when your assumption is that it's

00:16:12.600
Speaker 0: another Love, Simon and then you click on

00:16:14.680
Speaker 0: the Wikipedia page for it and it's Stream.

00:16:16.895
Speaker 0: Like Evan Hansen, a heterosexual male, lies to

00:16:19.695
Speaker 0: a grieving family whose son just died and

00:16:22.095
Speaker 0: scams his way into being close with them

00:16:24.015
Speaker 0: and dating their daughter and also everyone Stree

00:16:26.320
Speaker 0: fucking loves this show and it won a

00:16:27.840
Speaker 0: bunch of Tonys, you might be like, what

00:16:30.400
Speaker 0: the fuck? So there were a lot of

00:16:32.320
Speaker 0: hot takes on Dear Evan Hansen and how

00:16:34.545
Speaker 0: stre- How fucked up it is that this

00:16:35.665
Speaker 0: is a musical and, like, how nobody is

00:16:37.345
Speaker 0: talking about how fucked up this is and,

00:16:38.865
Speaker 0: like, this is so terrible and bad and

00:16:40.704
Speaker 0: etcetera etcetera Streamura. And it's not that there

00:16:43.260
Speaker 0: are no critiques to be made about how

00:16:45.260
Speaker 0: the show handles its themes. There's been a

00:16:47.339
Speaker 0: line of critique for quite a while that

00:16:49.180
Speaker 0: tries to deal with how the show portrays

00:16:51.035
Speaker 0: anxiety and whether Evan's actions are really treated

00:16:54.075
Speaker 0: appropriately by the story. But this was just

00:16:57.330
Speaker 0: like a lot of people who, like, read

00:16:59.650
Speaker 0: a Wikipedia summary and then went, oh my

00:17:02.290
Speaker 0: god, a morally ambiguous protagonist? That's not allowed.

00:17:06.545
Speaker 0: Fucked up. So rumors were swirling about what

00:17:09.185
Speaker 0: the deal with this show is, and some

00:17:11.265
Speaker 0: of the cast was announced, including Ben Platt

00:17:13.690
Speaker 0: Strat reprising his role as Dear, the show

00:17:16.010
Speaker 0: was kind of in this weird spot. You

00:17:17.929
Speaker 0: had a lot of hype for it from

00:17:19.450
Speaker 0: fans, especially just Ben Platt fans as he

00:17:21.609
Speaker 0: was still doing stuff like The Politician, but

00:17:23.904
Speaker 0: also this sudden shock and backlash as people

00:17:26.464
Speaker 0: learned what the show was actually about. And

00:17:29.184
Speaker 0: the closer and closer the movie's release date

00:17:31.424
Speaker 0: drew, True, especially when pictures of Ben Platt

00:17:33.929
Speaker 0: in the role were released and he very

00:17:35.850
Speaker 0: clearly looked, not like a high school student,

00:17:38.970
Speaker 0: the more this film became Strider of discourse

00:17:41.914
Speaker 0: and mockery. And with people surveying the upcoming

00:17:44.955
Speaker 0: film in this light also came a sort

00:17:47.034
Speaker 0: of revisiting of the musical in this discourse.

00:17:50.130
Speaker 0: Stores. So you'd see think pieces and videos

00:17:52.530
Speaker 0: and tweets that sort of tried to reconcile

00:17:54.690
Speaker 0: with this question of like, was Dear Evan

00:17:57.250
Speaker 0: Hansen actually ever good or was it always

00:18:00.415
Speaker 0: just kinda bad and overrated from the start?

00:18:03.695
Speaker 0: And I think that's actually an interesting thing

00:18:05.934
Speaker 0: to Strictly address because a movie that's bad

00:18:09.140
Speaker 0: because it adapted its source material poorly isn't

00:18:12.180
Speaker 0: necessarily the same thing as a movie that's

00:18:15.575
Speaker 0: because, like, its source material is bad. 1

00:18:19.175
Speaker 0: is the fault primarily of the source material,

00:18:21.735
Speaker 0: and the other is a failure to adapt

00:18:23.895
Speaker 0: it Strictly. So was Dear Evan Hansen ever

00:18:27.480
Speaker 0: actually good? Both in the sense of being

00:18:30.040
Speaker 0: a good piece of art and also in

00:18:31.880
Speaker 0: the sense of what it had to say

00:18:33.480
Speaker 0: about Mental Health. It was fine. Like, it's

00:18:37.684
Speaker 0: not a bad show in any sense. Depending

00:18:41.125
Speaker 0: on which actor you see cast to play

00:18:43.110
Speaker 0: Stray Evan, he can end up being a

00:18:45.030
Speaker 0: really compelling character. The way it depicted grief

00:18:48.150
Speaker 0: and all the different ways it can manifest

00:18:50.070
Speaker 0: with songs like Requiem is quite well done.

00:18:52.865
Speaker 0: There are numbers that are cute and that

00:18:54.705
Speaker 0: are funny, and it manages to tell a

00:18:56.784
Speaker 0: pretty decent story. Especially good about the show

00:18:59.985
Speaker 0: is the relationship between Evan and his mom.

00:19:03.310
Speaker 0: It manages to be a really good through

00:19:05.390
Speaker 0: line. The show starts with both Evan and

00:19:07.870
Speaker 0: Connor's moms trying desperately to shortly to connect

00:19:10.445
Speaker 0: with their sons, and when Evan's lies come

00:19:12.925
Speaker 0: crashing down upon him, we are reminded of

00:19:15.645
Speaker 0: the fact that in many ways, he is

00:19:17.405
Speaker 0: very much still a child through connection with

00:19:20.320
Speaker 0: his mother, a rocky but nevertheless unconditional love

00:19:23.760
Speaker 0: that both imbues Evan with a strong sense

00:19:26.080
Speaker 0: of sympathy and humanity, and also showcases her

00:19:29.345
Speaker 0: own struggles to raise her son while having

00:19:31.825
Speaker 0: to provide for him, and also watching him

00:19:34.625
Speaker 0: navigate this world of, like, stream social media

00:19:37.440
Speaker 0: virality that she doesn't necessarily understand. I think

00:19:40.960
Speaker 0: the show also does a good job of

00:19:42.720
Speaker 0: addressing the insincerity and performativeness Stream come with

00:19:45.754
Speaker 0: a student's death at school, of people treating

00:19:48.475
Speaker 0: folks who have killed themselves less as their

00:19:50.475
Speaker 0: own individuals and more as vessels Strings to

00:19:52.850
Speaker 0: communicate their own beliefs, or to symbolize something

00:19:55.730
Speaker 0: in their own lives, or as tools to

00:19:57.970
Speaker 0: gain popularity. There's a lot to like about

00:20:00.505
Speaker 0: this show, and I can easily understand why

00:20:03.065
Speaker 0: the most famous number from it, wading through

00:20:05.225
Speaker 0: a window, connected with and spoke to a

00:20:07.305
Speaker 0: lot of people. Just personally, I've seen it

00:20:09.780
Speaker 0: live a few times, and every time I

00:20:11.700
Speaker 0: have, I've enjoyed it, even if it wasn't

00:20:13.620
Speaker 0: the most life changing thing that made me

00:20:15.780
Speaker 0: reconsider the theater medium in a whole different

00:20:18.100
Speaker 0: way or anything like that. But it definitely

00:20:20.965
Speaker 0: has its weaknesses too. Some of it is

00:20:23.525
Speaker 0: just the inherent okay iness of the show.

00:20:27.310
Speaker 0: There's nothing really interesting or memorable about, for

00:20:30.270
Speaker 0: example, most of the music, and some of

00:20:32.190
Speaker 0: the songs are just very nothing. To break

00:20:34.975
Speaker 0: in a glove, the song sung by the

00:20:36.735
Speaker 0: very important character of Connor's dad is the

00:20:39.135
Speaker 0: most frequently criticized for its boring and forgettable

00:20:42.015
Speaker 0: nature, but Stree- songs like Only Us suffer

00:20:44.570
Speaker 0: from the same problem of failing to be

00:20:46.730
Speaker 0: especially good. The show taps into certain themes

00:20:49.530
Speaker 0: that are really interesting but fails to really

00:20:51.530
Speaker 0: explore them in their full depth. It's interesting

00:20:54.285
Speaker 0: to me that one of the things it

00:20:55.485
Speaker 0: got a lot of praise for when it

00:20:56.924
Speaker 0: first came out was its depiction of social

00:20:59.085
Speaker 0: media. Because like, yeah, we do see that

00:21:01.485
Speaker 0: a little. Evan is successful at his Connor

00:21:04.044
Speaker 0: [object venture because a speech he gives at

00:21:06.030
Speaker 0: a memorial for Connor goes viral on YouTube.

00:21:08.910
Speaker 0: My speech? People started sharing it, I guess.

00:21:11.225
Speaker 0: And now, I mean, Connor is everywhere.

00:21:12.825
Speaker 1: Your speech is everywhere. This morning, The Connor

00:21:15.705
Speaker 1: [object page, it only had 56 people following

00:21:18.425
Speaker 1: it. How many He doesn't have now. 4,516.

00:21:23.490
Speaker 0: 16,239. He is pushed to keep up the

00:21:26.530
Speaker 0: lie partly because a fundraiser in Streamers name

00:21:29.615
Speaker 0: starts. And the less he posts and continually

00:21:32.575
Speaker 0: makes stuff up about his relationship with Connor,

00:21:35.215
Speaker 0: the less likely it is to meet its

00:21:36.975
Speaker 0: goal. I think there is a lot to

00:21:39.200
Speaker 0: say with that, about how we're incentivised to

00:21:42.080
Speaker 0: keep making content, even in cases where it's

00:21:44.640
Speaker 0: to the detriment of yourself or others. After

00:21:47.895
Speaker 0: what people believe to be Connor's note goes

00:21:50.535
Speaker 0: viral, his grieving family is essentially directly blamed

00:21:54.215
Speaker 0: for his death and end up receiving a

00:21:56.330
Speaker 0: number of abusive comments and phone calls online.

00:21:59.690
Speaker 0: So it's definitely a present theme in the

00:22:02.250
Speaker 0: show, but it's very much only explored on

00:22:05.505
Speaker 0: a surface level. We don't get that much

00:22:07.985
Speaker 0: out of the depiction of social media, Strict

00:22:10.470
Speaker 0: that people are mean on it sometimes and

00:22:12.550
Speaker 0: going viral is weird. His internet fame doesn't

00:22:15.350
Speaker 0: really come up except in the context Streams.

00:22:18.315
Speaker 0: And we don't really learn anything new about

00:22:20.555
Speaker 0: how he sees himself, or how it allows

00:22:23.035
Speaker 0: him to act and relate to others, Stream,

00:22:25.179
Speaker 0: or how the instantaneousness of it specifically compared

00:22:28.299
Speaker 0: to in a pre social media age really

00:22:30.700
Speaker 0: affected his lie. Stream. It talks about social

00:22:33.355
Speaker 0: media, sure, but it doesn't really explore it

00:22:35.675
Speaker 0: in a particularly compelling way. There are weird

00:22:39.275
Speaker 0: little mental health nuances that also don't really

00:22:42.170
Speaker 0: get explored in interesting ways. Evan goes off

00:22:45.130
Speaker 0: his meds after becoming popular at school and

00:22:47.850
Speaker 0: starting to date Zoe Stream because, in his

00:22:49.915
Speaker 0: words, he doesn't need them anymore, and then

00:22:52.395
Speaker 0: the show just never revisits it. And I

00:22:55.675
Speaker 0: personally have no problem with the show being

00:22:57.835
Speaker 0: about a person who fucks up and does

00:22:59.790
Speaker 0: bad things, and I also think if you

00:23:01.630
Speaker 0: watch the show he comes off as a

00:23:03.390
Speaker 0: lot more sympathetic and much more Stream. I'm

00:23:05.745
Speaker 0: not sure if you're going to be able

00:23:06.825
Speaker 0: to get into the lie, but I'm not

00:23:07.969
Speaker 0: sure if you're going to be able to

00:23:08.993
Speaker 0: get into the lie, but it does at

00:23:10.305
Speaker 0: times struggle with how Evan and the other

00:23:12.305
Speaker 0: high schoolers are depicted in a mental Stre-

00:23:14.420
Speaker 0: Health Sense. One of the big critiques of

00:23:16.380
Speaker 0: Dear Evan Hansen is the idea that Evan

00:23:18.780
Speaker 0: isn't really sufficiently punished for the stuff he

00:23:21.420
Speaker 0: does. The show ends with the fundraiser having

00:23:24.445
Speaker 0: Successful and having brought back this old apple

00:23:27.005
Speaker 0: orchard the real Connor used to love and

00:23:29.085
Speaker 0: Zoe talking to Evan about the good that

00:23:31.245
Speaker 0: came from Evan's lie. So even though those

00:23:33.669
Speaker 0: 2 don't really talk anymore, there's still the

00:23:36.070
Speaker 0: tacit idea that what Evan did ultimately produced

00:23:39.190
Speaker 0: more good than bad, which is an interesting

00:23:41.909
Speaker 0: message. Stridge. I don't really agree with this

00:23:45.445
Speaker 0: point about punishment, mostly just because it doesn't

00:23:48.885
Speaker 0: have to be a morality play where Stream.

00:23:50.899
Speaker 0: We all must come see evildoers punished for

00:23:53.299
Speaker 0: their wickedness. And also just because, like, what

00:23:56.259
Speaker 0: do you want? He loses his girlfriend and

00:23:58.820
Speaker 0: doesn't get to reap any of the benefits

00:24:00.745
Speaker 0: from being a part of that family anymore.

00:24:03.225
Speaker 0: Do you want him to go to child

00:24:04.905
Speaker 0: jail too? Like, what? But at the same

00:24:07.945
Speaker 0: time, it does kind of struggle with what

00:24:11.010
Speaker 0: it wants you to take away from Evan's

00:24:13.250
Speaker 0: actions. They're clearly depicted as in the wrong

00:24:16.450
Speaker 0: throughout the Story, and it's very much beaten

00:24:18.965
Speaker 0: into the audience's head that Evan is doing

00:24:21.605
Speaker 0: a bad, just innately. But at the St-

00:24:24.140
Speaker 0: Same time, the show shies clear of showing

00:24:26.460
Speaker 0: us any real tangible ramifications for others besides

00:24:30.299
Speaker 0: some mean social media comments, which largely became

00:24:33.745
Speaker 0: a thing because of something Alana did, not

00:24:35.985
Speaker 0: something Evan did, and mostly just shows us

00:24:38.385
Speaker 0: the tangible good that came from Evan making

00:24:40.945
Speaker 0: Connor's Story Viral. Which is a shame because,

00:24:43.740
Speaker 0: again, there's a lot more they could get

00:24:46.140
Speaker 0: at with what that kind of social media

00:24:48.299
Speaker 0: exposure can do to a person, and they

00:24:50.299
Speaker 0: just stre- Don't. And finally, there's the fact

00:24:53.425
Speaker 0: that, for all the show is marketed as

00:24:55.985
Speaker 0: this inspirational story about suicide and mental health

00:24:59.665
Speaker 0: and whatnot, stre- all of the hashtag you

00:25:02.200
Speaker 0: will be found marketing- the actual death of

00:25:05.159
Speaker 0: Connor is really more a tangential plot device

00:25:08.085
Speaker 0: to a story which is fundamentally about Evan.

00:25:11.284
Speaker 0: Despite the story centring itself around Connor and

00:25:13.924
Speaker 0: his suicide, we see very little of him

00:25:16.485
Speaker 0: and what he and his life are actually

00:25:18.549
Speaker 0: like. And in some senses, this is intentional.

00:25:21.590
Speaker 0: One of the things the show critiques is

00:25:23.269
Speaker 0: the way real mentally ill people's real deaths

00:25:25.909
Speaker 0: are exploited or weaponized or projected upon by

00:25:29.085
Speaker 0: others, often people who didn't really know these

00:25:31.885
Speaker 0: folks or care to. But I think the

00:25:33.885
Speaker 0: message is weakened by the fact that the

00:25:36.000
Speaker 0: story itself also doesn't really care to learn

00:25:38.960
Speaker 0: much about Connor or to meaningfully center or

00:25:41.760
Speaker 0: explore his own feelings and issues. Connor and

00:25:44.855
Speaker 0: his death end up being little more than

00:25:47.255
Speaker 0: storytelling devices to further center Evan, and that

00:25:50.455
Speaker 0: can get St- fairly uncomfortable on its own,

00:25:53.290
Speaker 0: and also confuse the message upon which the

00:25:55.690
Speaker 0: show markets itself. And then there's the character

00:25:58.730
Speaker 0: of Alanna, who the show really struggles to

00:26:01.105
Speaker 0: make work. Alana is, depending on who you

00:26:03.745
Speaker 0: ask, either a bully who continually strong arms

00:26:06.865
Speaker 0: Evan into continuing the lie, Stream, going to

00:26:09.470
Speaker 0: some pretty terrible lengths that include publishing what

00:26:12.350
Speaker 0: she believes to be a suicide note against

00:26:14.510
Speaker 0: Evan's wishes, Stream. Or she's a direct foil

00:26:17.445
Speaker 0: to Evan, a depressed girl who, instead of

00:26:19.925
Speaker 0: withdrawing herself like Evan does, thrusts herself into

00:26:23.340
Speaker 0: every activity and extracurricular possible and yet is

00:26:26.700
Speaker 0: equally alone and desperate for friendship and recognition.

00:26:30.220
Speaker 0: And depending on how she's played, her Street-

00:26:32.465
Speaker 0: character might steer closer to either reading of

00:26:35.025
Speaker 0: her, which is largely because she simply doesn't

00:26:37.665
Speaker 0: get a lot of focus from the narrative.

00:26:40.145
Speaker 0: Unlike Evan or Zoe or St. Connor or

00:26:42.919
Speaker 0: even the other side teen Jared who gets

00:26:45.240
Speaker 0: bits in Sincerely Me, she doesn't get anything

00:26:47.960
Speaker 0: resembling a song or a deeper look into

00:26:50.804
Speaker 0: her own feelings and motivations besides a couple

00:26:53.684
Speaker 0: of ambiguous throwaway lines, which leaves her character

00:26:56.725
Speaker 0: somewhere between either a minor villain or Stricker

00:27:00.470
Speaker 0: designed to parallel Evan's own mental health struggles.

00:27:03.830
Speaker 0: It's not that she necessarily needs to be

00:27:05.750
Speaker 0: a strictly good or bad person, but rather

00:27:08.255
Speaker 0: that Alanna doesn't get enough depth or focus

00:27:10.735
Speaker 0: for either thing the writers were going for

00:27:13.055
Speaker 0: for her to really work. And so to

00:27:15.059
Speaker 0: see Alanna, who is also in many castings

00:27:17.460
Speaker 0: the only character of color in the show,

00:27:19.299
Speaker 0: be kind of uniquely sidelined in this way,

00:27:22.419
Speaker 0: kinda St sucks. All this to say that

00:27:24.325
Speaker 0: Dear Evan Hansen is really an okay show.

00:27:27.445
Speaker 0: There are some really good parts in it,

00:27:28.885
Speaker 0: and I can see why someone would love

00:27:30.645
Speaker 0: it, and there are also some pretty weak

00:27:32.470
Speaker 0: parts that make me understand why someone would

00:27:34.710
Speaker 0: either hate it or just not really feel

00:27:36.710
Speaker 0: much about it at all. It's, At least

00:27:38.895
Speaker 0: in my opinion, a safely mid tier show.

00:27:42.415
Speaker 0: One that could make a pretty decent movie

00:27:44.335
Speaker 0: if it played on its strengths, but at

00:27:46.280
Speaker 0: the same time also with a lot of

00:27:48.120
Speaker 0: room for things to work on and adapt

00:27:50.280
Speaker 0: and improve for a future version of itself.

00:27:52.760
Speaker 0: So a Dear Evan Hansen film could very

00:27:54.840
Speaker 0: much be Trinity to address some of those

00:27:57.325
Speaker 0: aforementioned story weaknesses, bulk out the stuff that

00:28:00.365
Speaker 0: works or needs more focus, and cut out

00:28:02.765
Speaker 0: the stuff that doesn't. But then it it

00:28:05.860
Speaker 0: wasn't bad. And it was, very bad and

00:28:09.140
Speaker 0: widely mocked. And actually, it ended up doing

00:28:11.700
Speaker 0: the direct opposite of what it could have

00:28:13.620
Speaker 0: done. It cut out stuff that was desperately

00:28:16.174
Speaker 0: needed while adding things that, some, were bad

00:28:19.375
Speaker 0: and didn't work. So like I said a

00:28:21.615
Speaker 0: while back, this video isn't just about Dear

00:28:24.380
Speaker 0: Evan Hansen. I mean, it is bad, and

00:28:26.060
Speaker 0: we are going to talk about that. But

00:28:27.900
Speaker 0: I want to look at it specifically from

00:28:29.660
Speaker 0: an adaptational stand Stream. Why this movie didn't

00:28:33.015
Speaker 0: work as an adaptation of a Broadway musical,

00:28:35.495
Speaker 0: and what it can tell us about other

00:28:37.335
Speaker 0: adaptations and the task of doing that in

00:28:39.414
Speaker 0: general. Because taking a story that's designed to

00:28:42.490
Speaker 0: be told on stage, and especially one that's

00:28:44.730
Speaker 0: designed to be told with music and dancing

00:28:46.809
Speaker 0: and larger than life a costume designed to

00:28:48.835
Speaker 0: be visible from the back of a theatre

00:28:50.835
Speaker 0: and placing it into a much more contained

00:28:53.235
Speaker 0: and intimate medium like film is always going

00:28:56.210
Speaker 0: to be a really big challenge. Which is

00:28:58.770
Speaker 0: why there's a massive litany of movie musicals

00:29:01.330
Speaker 0: out there that are safe to describe as,

00:29:03.330
Speaker 0: like, stre- Pretty okay, but not as good

00:29:06.115
Speaker 0: as the original. But then every once in

00:29:08.914
Speaker 0: a while, you get a Dear Evan Hansen.

00:29:11.260
Speaker 0: Stream. And there's just so much here that's

00:29:13.420
Speaker 0: just really telling in terms of the entire

00:29:16.380
Speaker 0: process of taking a musical and making it

00:29:18.620
Speaker 0: a movie. Very much a what not to

00:29:21.225
Speaker 0: do situation. So for starters, let's talk about

00:29:24.185
Speaker 0: casting and specifically how Dear Evan Hansen was

00:29:27.145
Speaker 0: cast and Why it's absolutely buck wild. I

00:29:37.545
Speaker 0: will say one single positive thing about the

00:29:40.185
Speaker 0: casting in the Dear Evan Hansen film, and

00:29:42.265
Speaker 0: that is the fact that James Corden is

00:29:44.310
Speaker 0: is not in it. Other than that, there's

00:29:47.110
Speaker 0: a lot to look at here. So Ben

00:29:49.510
Speaker 0: Platt being cast as Evan Hansen was one

00:29:51.670
Speaker 0: of the first announcements we Stream back in

00:29:54.445
Speaker 0: June 2020. And at the time, there wasn't

00:29:57.085
Speaker 0: really any big surprise at that revelation. He

00:29:59.885
Speaker 0: originated the role as far back as the

00:30:02.080
Speaker 0: very very start when the show was in

00:30:03.680
Speaker 0: its initial readings. He performed it at the

00:30:06.000
Speaker 0: Tony's, and he's considered the iconic face of

00:30:08.720
Speaker 0: Dear Evan Hansen. He'd played a high Jeweler

00:30:11.305
Speaker 0: in Ryan Murphy's The Politician, like, a year

00:30:13.865
Speaker 0: prior. His dad, Mark Platt, is a producer

00:30:17.145
Speaker 0: on the film. So, yeah. It was gonna

00:30:19.520
Speaker 0: be Ben Platt who played Evan. And, okay,

00:30:22.320
Speaker 0: I know that it's not an especially hot

00:30:24.560
Speaker 0: or revelatory take at this point to point

00:30:27.120
Speaker 0: out the track that he looks old in

00:30:28.825
Speaker 0: this movie, but holy fucking shit does he

00:30:31.065
Speaker 0: look old. The other actors cast to play

00:30:33.625
Speaker 0: high schoolers are, for the most part, Str-

00:30:35.730
Speaker 0: so in their mid to late twenties. Like,

00:30:37.410
Speaker 0: this is very standard for Hollywood at this

00:30:39.410
Speaker 0: point, but for the most part they mostly

00:30:41.809
Speaker 0: look like high schoolers or, at the very

00:30:44.290
Speaker 0: least, strangest what we've convinced ourselves in our

00:30:46.335
Speaker 0: head from watching a bunch of these movies

00:30:48.255
Speaker 0: that high schoolers kinda sorta look like, something

00:30:51.054
Speaker 0: that both makes Ben Platt look extremely out

00:30:53.695
Speaker 0: of place, and also makes the romance scenes

00:30:56.480
Speaker 0: between Evan and a much younger looking Zooey

00:30:59.040
Speaker 0: just feel intensely creepier. And it's also Stream.

00:31:02.275
Speaker 0: The fact that Ben Platt doesn't really look

00:31:04.755
Speaker 0: that old normally, but they gave him this

00:31:06.675
Speaker 0: weird haircut and lit him poorly, and so

00:31:08.835
Speaker 0: it's almost as if they were deliberately trying

00:31:11.169
Speaker 0: to age him like the end of Harry

00:31:12.769
Speaker 0: Potter. Also, side note, but the projector in

00:31:15.250
Speaker 0: the theater my co writer Emily saw this

00:31:16.929
Speaker 0: movie in was calibrated poorly and washed everything

00:31:19.409
Speaker 0: out and made Ben Platt's face look weirdly

00:31:21.715
Speaker 0: paler like polymer eraser white, which just made

00:31:24.515
Speaker 0: him look even more like a strange little

00:31:26.515
Speaker 0: freak. But the thing is, this isn't just

00:31:28.675
Speaker 0: a problem in the sense that it looks

00:31:30.355
Speaker 0: goofy being funny. It actually fucks with a

00:31:32.660
Speaker 0: really significant element of what makes this show

00:31:35.300
Speaker 0: mostly work on stage and makes the entire

00:31:37.940
Speaker 0: story much harder to swallow. The original musical

00:31:41.365
Speaker 0: for all its flaws and how exactly it

00:31:43.525
Speaker 0: depicts Evan and his actions gives you a

00:31:45.685
Speaker 0: sort of understanding as to how an extremely

00:31:48.620
Speaker 0: socially anxious suicidal kid with no real sense

00:31:51.340
Speaker 0: of assertiveness or self esteem could end up

00:31:53.420
Speaker 0: getting trapped in a lie because was too

00:31:55.675
Speaker 0: anxious to say something. Evan is immature, but

00:31:59.275
Speaker 0: his immaturity is a function of his age.

00:32:02.315
Speaker 0: We see Evan Stream. Not as a mustache

00:32:05.419
Speaker 0: twirling manipulator, but as a kid who fucked

00:32:08.380
Speaker 0: up. When we see Evan on stage, we

00:32:10.860
Speaker 0: judge him as we would judge a teenager.

00:32:13.565
Speaker 0: Stream when he lays his head on his

00:32:15.164
Speaker 0: mother's lap and finally gets to stop lying,

00:32:18.445
Speaker 0: we see that relief. And we see that,

00:32:20.764
Speaker 0: as bad as he's done, and as much

00:32:22.605
Speaker 0: as he needs to make amends, he's ultimately

00:32:25.310
Speaker 0: still a scared mentally ill kid. He's literally

00:32:29.070
Speaker 0: neurodivergent and a minor. But when we're looking

00:32:32.775
Speaker 0: at a now pushing 30 Ben Platt on

00:32:35.095
Speaker 0: camera and seeing the way he interacts with

00:32:37.255
Speaker 0: the world, it becomes painfully clear that we

00:32:40.215
Speaker 0: are watching and judging an adult man. All

00:32:43.800
Speaker 0: of Evan Hansen's immaturities and teenage faults are

00:32:47.160
Speaker 0: now deeply incongruous with what we are seeing

00:32:49.960
Speaker 0: on screen and therefore become less understandable to

00:32:53.315
Speaker 0: us and more so deeply inappropriate. And this

00:32:56.995
Speaker 0: again especially makes the romance section feel a

00:32:59.794
Speaker 0: lot more more manipulative and a lot more

00:33:02.308
Speaker 0: calculated, and so we spend a lot of

00:33:03.680
Speaker 0: the show not empathizing with Ben Platt as

00:33:06.240
Speaker 0: intended and understanding how his own problems brought

00:33:09.120
Speaker 0: him Street Bar and what it's done to

00:33:10.595
Speaker 0: him and others, but instead just being horrified

00:33:13.235
Speaker 0: that we're watching a serial killer origin story

00:33:15.715
Speaker 0: set to upbeat pop music. Stre- And the

00:33:18.310
Speaker 0: thing is, this is partly an issue of

00:33:20.790
Speaker 0: the translation between stage and screen. Besides the

00:33:24.390
Speaker 0: fact that Evan Hansen's broadway Strangers are already

00:33:27.294
Speaker 0: usually cast to be pretty young, like it

00:33:29.534
Speaker 0: generally tends to be actors in their early

00:33:31.615
Speaker 0: twenties playing Evan Hansen, you also streaking get

00:33:34.290
Speaker 0: away with a lot more looseness in your

00:33:36.450
Speaker 0: casting when you're on stage based on the

00:33:38.850
Speaker 0: inherent fantasy of what a stage show is.

00:33:42.365
Speaker 0: Everyone understands when they go see a staged

00:33:44.925
Speaker 0: production that the things happening on stage are,

00:33:47.405
Speaker 0: to some extent, non literal representations of The

00:33:50.330
Speaker 0: Story. So this is a really minor example,

00:33:52.575
Speaker 0: but the Dear Evan Hansen stage has a

00:33:54.820
Speaker 0: screen where social media posts will pop up

00:33:57.065
Speaker 0: throughout the show. This is obviously like a

00:33:59.144
Speaker 0: metaphorical representation of social media. The characters aren't

00:34:02.345
Speaker 0: literally having other people's Facebook posts blasted on

00:34:05.384
Speaker 0: a screen in front of them at their

00:34:06.870
Speaker 0: Stroll, it's there for the benefit of the

00:34:08.790
Speaker 0: audience, to convey what's happening in a non

00:34:11.350
Speaker 0: literal way. Or even take a show like

00:34:14.150
Speaker 0: Hamilton, which, Strict, for all its faults, is

00:34:16.185
Speaker 0: still relevant to discuss when we're talking about

00:34:18.265
Speaker 0: what can and can't happen on stage. The

00:34:20.745
Speaker 0: way ensemble members manifest Stream. Sometimes as audience

00:34:23.920
Speaker 0: stand ins, sometimes as historical onlookers, and sometimes

00:34:27.839
Speaker 0: as deeper representations of things inside the characters,

00:34:31.199
Speaker 0: like their Strip guilt isn't literal. There isn't

00:34:33.824
Speaker 0: literally a group of people screaming no no

00:34:36.705
Speaker 0: no at Alexander Hamilton when he's about to

00:34:39.425
Speaker 0: cheat on his wife. Basically, when you enter

00:34:42.279
Speaker 0: a staged space, you implicitly recognize that elements

00:34:46.039
Speaker 0: of it are going to be larger than

00:34:47.880
Speaker 0: life and that these things will act as

00:34:49.945
Speaker 0: stand ins for different things. Which is why,

00:34:52.824
Speaker 0: for example, an older actor can act as

00:34:55.304
Speaker 0: a representation of a younger character, and it

00:34:58.105
Speaker 0: doesn't necessarily matter Streamunch. Half the ensemble members

00:35:02.110
Speaker 0: in Matilda are children and half of them,

00:35:04.510
Speaker 0: the ones doing the more complicated choreography, stripy

00:35:07.265
Speaker 0: are adults. And it doesn't matter or look

00:35:09.425
Speaker 0: weird because we're pulled into the metaphorical space

00:35:12.385
Speaker 0: of Matilda. Or even going outside age. The

00:35:15.370
Speaker 0: Costumes in the Lion King aren't just fursuits

00:35:17.690
Speaker 0: designed to look like hyper realistic lions. They're

00:35:20.570
Speaker 0: a mix of literal masks and puppeteering to

00:35:23.050
Speaker 0: convey the image of the animal they're Stream

00:35:24.995
Speaker 0: presenting, but also just clothing and costumes that

00:35:27.555
Speaker 0: get at the character's personality and feeling, rather

00:35:30.115
Speaker 0: than an attempt to look like a literal

00:35:32.035
Speaker 0: lion. Stream. How a character looks in a

00:35:34.100
Speaker 0: Broadway show is often non literal, and that's

00:35:36.740
Speaker 0: recognized and understood by audiences. So if Ben

00:35:40.180
Speaker 0: Platt is a bit older than he used

00:35:42.095
Speaker 0: to be in the role, it's not really

00:35:44.015
Speaker 0: that big of a deal because we're already

00:35:46.335
Speaker 0: suspending visual disbelief by stepping into this space.

00:35:49.960
Speaker 0: Stream. The second reason is a lot more

00:35:51.880
Speaker 0: basic. Generally speaking, audience members at live shows

00:35:55.720
Speaker 0: aren't seeing actors in high Strip. They'll be

00:35:58.865
Speaker 0: seated many feet away, even in the best,

00:36:01.345
Speaker 0: most expensive seats, and sometimes an entire room

00:36:04.465
Speaker 0: away if you're in the nose leads. It's

00:36:06.619
Speaker 0: just a lot less weird and noticeable for

00:36:09.099
Speaker 0: a somewhat older actor to stand on stage

00:36:11.579
Speaker 0: live than it is when you're getting these

00:36:13.260
Speaker 0: close ups on their Space in a movie

00:36:14.805
Speaker 0: theater and every single wrinkle is on full

00:36:17.285
Speaker 0: display. Film is not only a typically much

00:36:20.405
Speaker 0: more literal representation of what we're seeing, which

00:36:22.990
Speaker 0: is why if they make a Matilda movie

00:36:24.830
Speaker 0: musical, adults playing elementary school students and hanging

00:36:28.110
Speaker 0: out with them on screen would look really

00:36:30.164
Speaker 0: fucking weird, but you also just get a

00:36:32.644
Speaker 0: much better look at people, seeing them up

00:36:35.125
Speaker 0: close and in a much more grounded and

00:36:37.204
Speaker 0: realistic setting. So when you're making a movie,

00:36:39.650
Speaker 0: whether it's with age or other physical traits

00:36:42.049
Speaker 0: about the musical characters, you need to be

00:36:44.210
Speaker 0: a lot more careful about the realism of

00:36:46.289
Speaker 0: whatever it is you're Strepiting. If you don't

00:36:48.765
Speaker 0: want whatever you're depicting in film to involve

00:36:50.925
Speaker 0: that kind of realism, it's going to take

00:36:52.685
Speaker 0: a lot more active effort because otherwise that's

00:36:55.245
Speaker 0: typically just the default of that medium. And

00:36:57.900
Speaker 0: when this falls apart for any reason, it's

00:36:59.900
Speaker 0: much more noticeable and problematic in film. Unless

00:37:03.180
Speaker 0: you're doing something like Mamma Mia, which just

00:37:05.225
Speaker 0: doesn't give a shit and doesn't pretend to

00:37:07.065
Speaker 0: give a shit. If your actors look slightly

00:37:09.465
Speaker 0: off for the part, it's incredibly obvious. Meryl

00:37:12.580
Speaker 0: streep is obviously an amazing actor, but the

00:37:14.980
Speaker 0: way she was cast and styled in something

00:37:17.300
Speaker 0: like Into the Woods, which is my favorite

00:37:19.140
Speaker 0: musical and I feel very strongly about this,

00:37:22.175
Speaker 0: Stream. Just doesn't work in the more toned

00:37:24.175
Speaker 0: down, grounded approach it has on film compared

00:37:26.815
Speaker 0: to stage. Look at Bernadette Peters' costuming and

00:37:30.095
Speaker 0: prosthetics streaksuse to make her look like this

00:37:32.220
Speaker 0: cartoonish old witch lady, and you can see

00:37:34.780
Speaker 0: how big and dramatic that shift later is

00:37:37.420
Speaker 0: when she's transformed back into a Beautiful Woman.

00:37:40.805
Speaker 0: That big shift probably wouldn't work as well

00:37:43.205
Speaker 0: in live action film just in general because

00:37:45.445
Speaker 0: of the cartoonishness of it, but they stri-

00:37:47.902
Speaker 0: try to resolve this in the film with

00:37:50.559
Speaker 0: a much more realistic witch and that makes

00:37:53.217
Speaker 0: the big transformation look like very nothing. Like,

00:37:56.035
Speaker 0: She just has neater hair and slightly fewer

00:37:58.835
Speaker 0: wrinkles and bags under her eyes. She didn't

00:38:01.395
Speaker 0: need to send everyone in her little magic

00:38:03.715
Speaker 0: village on a fetch stretch quest for beauty.

00:38:05.850
Speaker 0: She could just brush her hair and put

00:38:07.290
Speaker 0: a bit of foundation on and she would

00:38:08.890
Speaker 0: look the exact same. And the fact that

00:38:10.730
Speaker 0: we are looking at her up close throughout

00:38:12.810
Speaker 0: every scene she's in in this Stream means

00:38:15.175
Speaker 0: that we can tell, extremely fucking well, what

00:38:18.375
Speaker 0: the differences in that transformation are. And so,

00:38:21.495
Speaker 0: necessarily, we judge it in the context of

00:38:23.655
Speaker 0: its realism. Realism. In terms of casting for

00:38:25.810
Speaker 0: the rest of Dear Evan Hansen, it's for

00:38:27.810
Speaker 0: the most part fine. There were some criticisms

00:38:30.690
Speaker 0: that I frankly don't feel the most qualified

00:38:33.089
Speaker 0: to go Super in-depth, too, about Amandla Stenberg's

00:38:35.895
Speaker 0: casting as Alanna, as often it is a

00:38:38.055
Speaker 0: dark skinned actor playing that role on stage

00:38:40.215
Speaker 0: and there aren't a lot of roles for

00:38:41.720
Speaker 0: dark skinned women, but other than their casting,

00:38:44.440
Speaker 0: everyone is ranging from passable to pretty good

00:38:47.480
Speaker 0: at their job. Stream. Amy Adams and Julianne

00:38:49.964
Speaker 0: Moore are doing their best despite their reduced

00:38:52.605
Speaker 0: roles in the show, Caitlin Dever is as

00:38:54.924
Speaker 0: good an actor as any as Zoe, and

00:38:56.924
Speaker 0: the Connor and the Jared are mostly fine.

00:38:59.940
Speaker 0: This is a cast that, theoretically, should be

00:39:02.099
Speaker 0: able to carry the story despite the unfortunate

00:39:06.339
Speaker 0: inclusion as a poorly Child Ben Platt as

00:39:09.125
Speaker 0: Evan. But so much of the story still

00:39:12.165
Speaker 0: hinges on Evan. Very much, more than it

00:39:15.205
Speaker 0: is a story about Stree- Connor or Evan's

00:39:17.800
Speaker 0: mom or the Murphys or anyone else, this

00:39:20.839
Speaker 0: is about Evan and his own mental health.

00:39:22.920
Speaker 0: And So when virtually everything he does in

00:39:25.535
Speaker 0: this show comes off as deranged because we

00:39:27.935
Speaker 0: no longer understand him as a mentally ill

00:39:30.655
Speaker 0: teen who stumbled into the lie, and when

00:39:33.059
Speaker 0: we are therefore constantly pulled out of getting

00:39:35.539
Speaker 0: any real investment in the story because we're

00:39:38.180
Speaker 0: distracted by how just fucking weird and out

00:39:41.059
Speaker 0: of place Evan Hansen Streeks, we can't necessarily

00:39:44.425
Speaker 0: get as invested in any parts of the

00:39:46.744
Speaker 0: story at all in the way that we

00:39:48.585
Speaker 0: could on stage. But even in scenes that

00:39:51.385
Speaker 0: aren't largely about 7, like in the Requiem

00:39:53.850
Speaker 0: scene, we still can't get fully invested in

00:39:56.330
Speaker 0: the story, and that's because the faults of

00:39:58.250
Speaker 0: this film go beyond just who is acting

00:40:00.625
Speaker 0: in it. Another really key element to making

00:40:03.345
Speaker 0: Broadway work on film is what you do

00:40:05.585
Speaker 0: with the music, and the film unfortunately fucks

00:40:08.785
Speaker 0: this up too. Stream. So something that's just

00:40:15.770
Speaker 0: become accepted as a thing that happens when

00:40:18.010
Speaker 0: musicals get adapted to Stream is that, generally

00:40:20.685
Speaker 0: speaking, 2 things are going to happen. You

00:40:23.405
Speaker 0: are going to lose some of the songs

00:40:25.245
Speaker 0: from the stage version, and there is always

00:40:27.085
Speaker 0: going to be at least one new song

00:40:28.790
Speaker 0: Strong written specifically for the movie musical. So

00:40:31.750
Speaker 0: for example, you have Suddenly, the one that

00:40:33.670
Speaker 0: Valjean sings to Gazette when they're in the

00:40:35.430
Speaker 0: wagon together, or you have all the new

00:40:37.430
Speaker 0: songs in those stri- action Disney adaptations like

00:40:40.195
Speaker 0: Evermore in Beauty and the Beast or the

00:40:42.195
Speaker 0: Girlboss song in Aladdin or fucking beautiful ghosts

00:40:44.675
Speaker 0: from the Cats movie. And generally speaking, this

00:40:47.050
Speaker 0: is just something you're going to have to

00:40:48.810
Speaker 0: expect in a film adaptation. And in all

00:40:51.130
Speaker 0: fairness, these aren't always Str- add songs. Mean

00:40:54.805
Speaker 0: Green Mother from Outer Space was written for

00:40:56.724
Speaker 0: the film adaptation of Little Shop of Horrors

00:40:59.045
Speaker 0: and it's now considered an iconic part of

00:41:01.125
Speaker 0: the musical. Or Lady's Choice, written for the

00:41:03.620
Speaker 0: Hairspray movie, manages to be pretty catchy and

00:41:06.420
Speaker 0: give Zac Efron more of a chance to

00:41:08.500
Speaker 0: sing. But these are generally known for being

00:41:11.685
Speaker 0: Kind of forgettable and kind of cynical. Part

00:41:15.205
Speaker 0: of it is that everyone knows the real

00:41:17.045
Speaker 0: reason these songs tend to be added to

00:41:19.289
Speaker 0: Films is so they can vie for award

00:41:21.210
Speaker 0: nominations and get wins for best original song.

00:41:24.569
Speaker 0: Which, you know, is fine. If they wanna

00:41:26.329
Speaker 0: write a nice song and get awards for

00:41:27.849
Speaker 0: it, sure. But it always feels so disingenuous

00:41:30.914
Speaker 0: when you then hear Tom Hooper go on

00:41:32.994
Speaker 0: about how acknowledging that Jean Valjean likes being

00:41:35.795
Speaker 0: a Strad was missing from his journey before

00:41:38.200
Speaker 0: and how there were these deep gaps in

00:41:39.960
Speaker 0: the original that only a new song could

00:41:42.120
Speaker 0: fill and it's kind of like, come on.

00:41:44.835
Speaker 0: We all know that that is absolutely never

00:41:47.075
Speaker 0: the real reason. It sucks. But it can

00:41:49.635
Speaker 0: also have the effect of these songs feeling

00:41:52.035
Speaker 0: 1, really shoehorned into awkward Stree in the

00:41:55.010
Speaker 0: story, and 2, the songs being very generic.

00:41:58.530
Speaker 0: That was one of the biggest criticisms of

00:42:00.210
Speaker 0: the songs in The Greatest Showman. It was

00:42:01.810
Speaker 0: a musical that felt like it hated being

00:42:03.795
Speaker 0: a musical, and the bland songs with generic

00:42:06.434
Speaker 0: lyrics about romance and whatnot really didn't help.

00:42:09.795
Speaker 0: Oftentimes, these added songs don't Stream. I tend

00:42:12.100
Speaker 0: to really reference the characters or story in

00:42:14.740
Speaker 0: the way the other songs in the show

00:42:16.500
Speaker 0: do, but rather seem to exist strictly to

00:42:19.275
Speaker 0: be listened to outside of the context of

00:42:21.674
Speaker 0: the show. To have pop covers and be

00:42:24.234
Speaker 0: streamed all the time, to sound inspirational and

00:42:26.795
Speaker 0: make money, rather than to Street fit well

00:42:29.420
Speaker 0: into the show. That's why most of the

00:42:31.660
Speaker 0: time when you go see a movie musical,

00:42:33.660
Speaker 0: even if you're not super familiar with the

00:42:36.205
Speaker 0: Streamal Music, it tends to be incredibly easy

00:42:39.005
Speaker 0: to point out which song was added later.

00:42:41.405
Speaker 0: But in the case of Dear Evan Hansen,

00:42:43.005
Speaker 0: they did actually have a real Strunity here

00:42:45.119
Speaker 0: with Alanna. This is a character who doesn't

00:42:47.680
Speaker 0: get that much exploration or development in the

00:42:50.400
Speaker 0: original show, who there's clearly a lot of

00:42:52.559
Speaker 0: potential to further explore. Stream. She's the only

00:42:55.075
Speaker 0: one of the 5 named teenage characters who

00:42:57.555
Speaker 0: doesn't really sing that much, and we don't

00:42:59.475
Speaker 0: learn much about her. So giving Alanna her

00:43:01.875
Speaker 0: own song could Stream really work out in

00:43:03.940
Speaker 0: the film's favour? Unfortunately, this doesn't. So Amandla

00:43:08.020
Speaker 0: Stenberg actually wrote the song Alana gets in

00:43:10.500
Speaker 0: the movie called The Anonymous Strips 1's. It

00:43:13.085
Speaker 0: expands a little bit on Alana's own mental

00:43:15.325
Speaker 0: health, referencing how she needs medication to function,

00:43:18.204
Speaker 0: and is basically about the idea that lots

00:43:20.500
Speaker 0: St- people go unnoticed and slip through the

00:43:22.820
Speaker 0: cracks, and it's kind of just thematically an

00:43:25.540
Speaker 0: expanded version of waving through a window. It

00:43:28.020
Speaker 0: shows that Evan isn't the only one suffering

00:43:30.615
Speaker 0: in this way. In terms of that message,

00:43:40.360
Speaker 0: you kind of already get that with You

00:43:42.280
Speaker 0: Will Be Found, but the primary purpose of

00:43:44.680
Speaker 0: the anonymous ones really is to Strand a

00:43:47.135
Speaker 0: bit on Alanna's character where we didn't see

00:43:49.455
Speaker 0: much of it in the show. So in

00:43:51.615
Speaker 0: order to understand what doesn't work here, we

00:43:53.935
Speaker 0: need to look at the way Stenberg plays

00:43:56.095
Speaker 0: Alanna. I'm not really sure how much of

00:43:58.430
Speaker 0: this was their own choice and how much

00:44:00.110
Speaker 0: of this was how they were told to

00:44:01.390
Speaker 0: play it, but I'm assuming this was mostly

00:44:03.765
Speaker 0: a directing decision because it's a problem with

00:44:06.244
Speaker 0: basically all of the line delivery in the

00:44:08.325
Speaker 0: film. I'll talk about this more in-depth later,

00:44:11.365
Speaker 0: but Pretty much every line in the film,

00:44:13.680
Speaker 0: including ones directly from the show that were

00:44:15.920
Speaker 0: played out in a comedic context, is delivered

00:44:18.400
Speaker 0: in the most our depressing way possible. Everyone

00:44:21.875
Speaker 0: is quiet and sad when they meet each

00:44:23.875
Speaker 0: other in the hallways or talk about their

00:44:25.955
Speaker 0: mental health, and so lines from the show

00:44:28.100
Speaker 0: that read as jokes now are just played

00:44:30.420
Speaker 0: straight and very depressingly. They even cut a

00:44:33.380
Speaker 0: line from one of the songs where Evan

00:44:35.140
Speaker 0: accidentally stumbles on his words and something comes

00:44:37.685
Speaker 0: out really wrong, which is a cute little

00:44:39.445
Speaker 0: joke that's just not in the film. We

00:44:44.940
Speaker 1: You looked really pretty or it looked pretty

00:44:48.140
Speaker 1: cool when you climbed indigo streaks In your

00:44:51.924
Speaker 1: hair. He did? He thought it looked pretty

00:44:57.605
Speaker 1: cool when you put Indigo streaks in your

00:45:01.180
Speaker 1: hair.

00:45:01.820
Speaker 0: But Alana as a character especially suffers from

00:45:04.700
Speaker 0: this. In the show, especially At the beginning,

00:45:07.265
Speaker 0: she carries a very upbeat, involved energy. For

00:45:10.625
Speaker 0: the 3 of you watching who know who

00:45:12.145
Speaker 0: Mira is, it's very Mira. So what we

00:45:14.065
Speaker 0: get at when we see little slivers of

00:45:15.870
Speaker 0: the way she talks and acts later in

00:45:17.990
Speaker 0: the show, although it's not hugely expanded upon,

00:45:20.550
Speaker 0: is that this is a character who uses

00:45:22.515
Speaker 0: clubs and achievements and high grades in order

00:45:25.075
Speaker 0: to cope with a deep sense of loneliness.

00:45:27.635
Speaker 1: Hey. How was your summer? Stream. Mine was

00:45:31.620
Speaker 1: productive. I did 3 internships and 90 hours

00:45:34.580
Speaker 1: of community service.

00:45:36.100
Speaker 0: The idea is that Alana is not a

00:45:38.100
Speaker 0: person you would expect to be depressed, unlike

00:45:40.785
Speaker 0: someone like Evan whose anxiety is, well, very

00:45:43.665
Speaker 0: noticeable. But the issue with the way this

00:45:46.224
Speaker 0: film presents strana is that now, every single

00:45:48.930
Speaker 0: time she speaks to Evan or gives a

00:45:50.770
Speaker 0: speech to the school, she doesn't sound like

00:45:52.770
Speaker 0: she's even trying to be upbeat. There's no

00:45:55.415
Speaker 0: moment of the mask slipping and making us

00:45:58.055
Speaker 0: reconsider our perspective on what a depressed person

00:46:00.855
Speaker 0: looks like, because she seems exceptionally sad every

00:46:03.540
Speaker 0: single time she delivers a line. Phenomenal, really.

00:46:06.500
Speaker 0: You know what's not phenomenal? Deforestation. So to

00:46:11.515
Speaker 0: explain what we're going to be asking of

00:46:13.115
Speaker 0: you, I'm gonna turn things over to our

00:46:15.355
Speaker 0: director of global communications.

00:46:18.859
Speaker 1: Thing about the emails is just that, like,

00:46:21.099
Speaker 1: you and Connor keep talking about climbing this

00:46:23.180
Speaker 1: tree together in June. Mhmm. We weren't school

00:46:26.380
Speaker 1: in June.

00:46:27.055
Speaker 0: So for Alana to have this scene and

00:46:29.215
Speaker 0: this entire musical number where she talks to

00:46:31.615
Speaker 0: Evan and goes, Hey, I know no one

00:46:33.855
Speaker 0: suspects this about me and nobody knows this,

00:46:36.619
Speaker 0: but I'm actually really sad a lot of

00:46:38.619
Speaker 0: the time doesn't work because it's like, really?

00:46:42.220
Speaker 0: No one would suspect that a character who

00:46:44.060
Speaker 0: delivers every line like it's Stream. It's really

00:46:48.645
Speaker 0: disappointing, actually, that we don't get the opportunity

00:46:51.125
Speaker 0: to learn more about Alanna and maybe her

00:46:53.125
Speaker 0: home life and her own struggles, because that

00:46:55.390
Speaker 0: was missing in the original show. And we

00:46:57.710
Speaker 0: do have one of those rare opportunities here

00:47:00.110
Speaker 0: where adding a show to a movie musical

00:47:02.270
Speaker 0: would actually fill a gap in the original.

00:47:04.744
Speaker 0: It's just disappointing, in all honesty. But the

00:47:07.385
Speaker 0: anonymous ones doesn't only exist as an attempt

00:47:10.345
Speaker 0: to expand upon Alana's story and or win

00:47:12.984
Speaker 0: best original Streamsong. It also serves to replace

00:47:15.840
Speaker 0: a couple songs from the show that were

00:47:17.760
Speaker 0: removed in the film. This is a tough

00:47:19.680
Speaker 0: position to tackle when you're adapting a musical

00:47:21.920
Speaker 0: for the screen. On top of being St-

00:47:24.058
Speaker 0: talk full of songs, another thing about Broadway

00:47:26.565
Speaker 0: musicals is that they tend to be very

00:47:29.072
Speaker 0: long. You tend to be in for a

00:47:31.579
Speaker 0: 2 and a half hour experience and the

00:47:33.940
Speaker 0: idea is that you are going to get

00:47:35.619
Speaker 0: your money's worth. So when you're adapting something

00:47:38.420
Speaker 0: like that to screen, it's not surprising that,

00:47:40.820
Speaker 0: oftentimes, certain and songs are just going to

00:47:43.675
Speaker 0: have to get cut. Or sometimes there are

00:47:45.835
Speaker 0: songs that might not necessarily work as well

00:47:48.075
Speaker 0: on stage as they do in a film.

00:47:49.755
Speaker 0: I'm gonna talk you in a bit about

00:47:51.240
Speaker 0: an entire musical that just probably never should

00:47:53.720
Speaker 0: have been a film because there's no real

00:47:55.560
Speaker 0: good way imaginable that you could have pulled

00:47:57.480
Speaker 0: it off. Stream. Or sometimes certain songs are

00:48:00.005
Speaker 0: just bad. The fact that the song Mooning

00:48:02.005
Speaker 0: isn't in the Grease movie is not some

00:48:03.765
Speaker 0: horrible travesty. But these things don't just Stree-

00:48:06.650
Speaker 0: affect the cast recording or the numbers or

00:48:08.490
Speaker 0: any of that. You can't get rid of

00:48:10.490
Speaker 0: or modify songs without that having an effect

00:48:13.130
Speaker 0: on the story, and a lot of the

00:48:14.730
Speaker 0: time that effect is negative. Strv. Generally speaking,

00:48:18.155
Speaker 0: music isn't thrust haphazardously into a show with

00:48:21.355
Speaker 0: no consideration for when a song should exist

00:48:23.915
Speaker 0: or why. Unless a musical is totally sung

00:48:26.710
Speaker 0: through, like Les Mis or Hamilton, songs are

00:48:29.030
Speaker 0: placed at specific points in the story, with

00:48:31.110
Speaker 0: the most common adage about it being you

00:48:33.190
Speaker 0: sing when you can no longer Street. These

00:48:36.025
Speaker 0: tend to be points of heightened emotion that

00:48:38.265
Speaker 0: are either personally important to the characters or

00:48:40.905
Speaker 0: just important to the broader story. So, for

00:48:43.625
Speaker 0: example, in Dear Treven Hansen, the song Requiem

00:48:46.490
Speaker 0: isn't just in there because it sounds pretty.

00:48:49.369
Speaker 0: Requiem is about all 3 of Connor's surviving

00:48:52.250
Speaker 0: relatives having different perspectives on how to grieve

00:48:55.545
Speaker 0: Connor, things none of them are willing or

00:48:57.625
Speaker 0: able to talk about with one another again.

00:48:59.625
Speaker 0: So watching each of Stream on their own

00:49:01.810
Speaker 0: singing their verses about their complicated feelings on

00:49:04.530
Speaker 0: their son's death, furthers our understanding of these

00:49:07.490
Speaker 0: characters in a way you can't necessarily get

00:49:09.890
Speaker 0: with dialogue. The song is really important, and

00:49:12.914
Speaker 0: it's important that that is a song. Or

00:49:15.555
Speaker 0: take the Into the Woods movie. God, I

00:49:17.394
Speaker 0: hate that movie. I hate that movie so

00:49:18.994
Speaker 0: much. Stri- Horrible adaptation of absolutely incredible source

00:49:22.359
Speaker 0: material. In terms of toning down a lot

00:49:24.680
Speaker 0: of the themes and darker elements of the

00:49:26.440
Speaker 0: show and just making it like, oh, pretty

00:49:28.415
Speaker 0: Storytale, they also cut the entire subplot with

00:49:31.375
Speaker 0: the baker and his father and most of

00:49:33.215
Speaker 0: the Rapunzel stuff. So for those of you

00:49:34.895
Speaker 0: who haven't seen Into the Woods, which is

00:49:38.980
Speaker 1: Stream. I'm assuming most people, one of the

00:49:39.078
Speaker 1: themes

00:49:39.090
Speaker 0: is that the witch in this story, who

00:49:40.020
Speaker 0: is one of the best characters in anything

00:49:41.859
Speaker 0: ever and I love her, basically locks Rapunzel,

00:49:44.819
Speaker 0: her Str- I guess adoptive is a weird

00:49:47.605
Speaker 0: word- her kidnapped daughter in a tower for

00:49:50.245
Speaker 0: most of her life, something we later see

00:49:52.165
Speaker 0: in the show explicitly traumatizes Stitcher and makes

00:49:54.830
Speaker 0: her unable to interact normally with other people

00:49:57.630
Speaker 0: and later even leads to her dying. This

00:50:00.190
Speaker 0: is unsurprisingly not in the film because it

00:50:02.670
Speaker 0: is a Disney movie and they're not going

00:50:04.415
Speaker 0: to kill off one of their princesses. So

00:50:06.815
Speaker 0: she's just barely in it, and then she

00:50:08.494
Speaker 0: just leaves. And the baker, one of the

00:50:10.890
Speaker 0: leads, is also struggling to process the death

00:50:13.370
Speaker 0: of his wife while also parenting a newborn

00:50:15.850
Speaker 0: baby, and is tempted to just walk away

00:50:18.170
Speaker 0: from the responsibility of being a parent. Stre-

00:50:21.005
Speaker 0: And then he has this song conversation with

00:50:23.484
Speaker 0: his own father, who did exactly that, walked

00:50:26.045
Speaker 0: away from being a parent, and it's kind

00:50:27.724
Speaker 0: of about Stream breaking the cycle and making

00:50:29.700
Speaker 0: the choice to be better, and again, really

00:50:31.940
Speaker 0: important that this is a song. The film,

00:50:34.660
Speaker 0: by cutting these songs out and therefore by

00:50:36.820
Speaker 0: cutting both subplots, are essentially erasing an entire

00:50:39.815
Speaker 0: theme of the show, which is largely about

00:50:41.815
Speaker 0: how we are shaped by the way we're

00:50:43.575
Speaker 0: raised and the way trauma can be passed

00:50:45.575
Speaker 0: on and our responsibility to our Children. So

00:50:48.640
Speaker 0: at the end of the movie, when they're

00:50:49.920
Speaker 0: all singing like, be careful the things you

00:50:52.000
Speaker 0: say, children will listen, it really rings hollow

00:50:55.040
Speaker 0: because, like, What the fuck are they talking

00:50:57.275
Speaker 0: about? What does this have to do with

00:50:59.275
Speaker 0: anything we just watched in this movie? Why

00:51:02.475
Speaker 0: are we singing about Stroke How We Raise

00:51:04.510
Speaker 0: Our Children All of a Sudden. This is

00:51:06.430
Speaker 0: especially salient given that the show's creator, Stephen

00:51:09.470
Speaker 0: Sondheim, was himself a survivor of parental abuse

00:51:12.494
Speaker 0: and emotional neglect, and large portions of the

00:51:15.215
Speaker 0: story are explicitly a reflection on this and

00:51:17.695
Speaker 0: on the consequences on our own childhoods. In

00:51:20.770
Speaker 0: many ways, this theme is the show. My

00:51:23.650
Speaker 0: point is that cutting songs from musicals is

00:51:26.050
Speaker 0: often a necessary thing, but it's also a

00:51:28.530
Speaker 0: very risky one. You risk either taking moments

00:51:31.335
Speaker 0: of heightened emotion and reducing their importance to

00:51:33.974
Speaker 0: the story or just disregarding key themes from

00:51:36.615
Speaker 0: the narrative you're trying to tell. All this

00:51:38.960
Speaker 0: doesn't mean you should never cut certain numbers

00:51:41.200
Speaker 0: from a show, but rather that you need

00:51:42.960
Speaker 0: to be conscious about what you're cutting and

00:51:45.040
Speaker 0: why and what, if anything, you replace it

00:51:47.359
Speaker 0: with. Stre- And, once again, Dear Evan Hansen

00:51:51.005
Speaker 0: does not do that. So, To Break in

00:51:53.165
Speaker 0: a Glove, the shitty boring song that has

00:51:55.645
Speaker 0: Evan, who never really knew his dad, St.

00:51:57.870
Speaker 0: Bonding with Connor's conservative Wasp dad gets cut,

00:52:01.070
Speaker 0: which is fine. No one liked that song

00:52:03.070
Speaker 0: anyway. But they also cut the opening song

00:52:06.190
Speaker 0: of the musical, the one that St. Sets

00:52:08.189
Speaker 0: the tone for the entire thing. Does anybody

00:52:10.685
Speaker 0: have a map? And this song is basically

00:52:13.181
Speaker 0: showcasing Evan's mom and Connor's mom at the

00:52:15.677
Speaker 0: same time, and their own struggles trying to

00:52:17.843
Speaker 0: connect with their kids. Stream. It serves a

00:52:29.195
Speaker 0: few purposes. For 1, it centers Evan's mother

00:52:31.915
Speaker 0: Heidi as an important character whose own struggles

00:52:34.790
Speaker 0: and worries we see beyond just being a

00:52:36.950
Speaker 0: mom whose job is mom. It lets us

00:52:39.750
Speaker 0: see more of Connor and how he relates

00:52:41.745
Speaker 0: to his family and what his home life

00:52:43.505
Speaker 0: was like, which is important given how little

00:52:45.825
Speaker 0: Connor as Connor actually features in this show.

00:52:49.265
Speaker 0: It establishes a central theme of the musical,

00:52:51.610
Speaker 0: Stroll, which is that, as much as the

00:52:52.890
Speaker 0: Hansen family and the Murphy family exist within

00:52:55.610
Speaker 0: different structures and different socioeconomic classes, Stream. Their

00:52:59.355
Speaker 0: struggles with their children are fundamentally the same.

00:53:02.315
Speaker 0: The moms are singing the same words at

00:53:04.635
Speaker 0: the same time for a reason. And cutting

00:53:07.330
Speaker 0: it, instead opening right with Evans singing Waving

00:53:09.970
Speaker 0: Through a Window, really reduces the importance of

00:53:12.450
Speaker 0: these themes. Also, just from a nitpicky Street

00:53:15.525
Speaker 0: or Nerd Perspective, you don't open with the

00:53:17.525
Speaker 0: I Want song. The I Want song is

00:53:19.365
Speaker 0: almost always the second or sometimes third song

00:53:21.925
Speaker 0: in the show because generally speaking, songs that

00:53:24.005
Speaker 0: exist to Establish the World and the stakes

00:53:26.080
Speaker 0: come first for a reason. You can't have

00:53:28.400
Speaker 0: a how far I'll go without having a

00:53:30.720
Speaker 0: where you are. You can't have I Have

00:53:33.194
Speaker 0: Confidence without How Do You Solve a Problem

00:53:35.434
Speaker 0: Like Maria? You need to establish who or

00:53:37.914
Speaker 0: what the world is before it matters what

00:53:40.230
Speaker 0: a character wants or feels within its constraints.

00:53:43.190
Speaker 0: Just fucking hell. But in particular, the way

00:53:46.630
Speaker 0: this, and the film in general, Stree cuts

00:53:48.815
Speaker 0: down on Evan's relationship with his mom is

00:53:51.455
Speaker 0: a real problem. Because on top of cutting,

00:53:54.494
Speaker 0: does anybody have a map? They also cut

00:53:56.670
Speaker 0: Good 4 You, one of the best and

00:53:58.270
Speaker 0: actually most important songs in the show. Stream.

00:54:14.290
Speaker 0: Good For You serves a crucial narrative purpose.

00:54:17.490
Speaker 0: At this point, we reach the part in

00:54:19.010
Speaker 0: the story where St- Evan is starting to

00:54:20.935
Speaker 0: get wrapped up in his lies. He's moved

00:54:23.494
Speaker 0: from being someone to whom the lies kind

00:54:25.575
Speaker 0: of accidentally happened to someone who is actively

00:54:28.640
Speaker 0: making the choice to keep telling them, because

00:54:30.880
Speaker 0: the benefits he gets from it are making

00:54:32.880
Speaker 0: him feel good. His relationship with Zoe is

00:54:35.680
Speaker 0: going great, he keeps going over to the

00:54:37.495
Speaker 0: Murphy's house and basically treating them as surrogate

00:54:40.135
Speaker 0: parents, and as a result he's neglecting his

00:54:42.855
Speaker 0: role in the charity he helped start, he's

00:54:44.855
Speaker 0: neglecting his Friendship with Jared, and he's neglecting

00:54:47.950
Speaker 0: his relationship with his actual mother. The Murphys

00:54:51.150
Speaker 0: even offer to pay for him to go

00:54:52.829
Speaker 0: off to university, something that makes his own

00:54:55.225
Speaker 0: mom Heidi feel extremely embarrassed and belittled, and

00:54:58.425
Speaker 0: Evan is extremely on board with this, something

00:55:00.825
Speaker 0: that we as the audience Show is built

00:55:02.560
Speaker 0: on the lies he is now actively choosing

00:55:05.120
Speaker 0: to continually tell to this family. And so

00:55:08.480
Speaker 0: Good 4 You is the number where Strana,

00:55:10.785
Speaker 0: Jared, and most importantly Heidi are basically singing

00:55:14.145
Speaker 0: this to him. They're talking about how Evan

00:55:16.785
Speaker 0: is treating them as disposable. How he's only

00:55:19.585
Speaker 0: being with these people to the extent that

00:55:21.380
Speaker 0: he can use them for personal gain. Jared,

00:55:24.100
Speaker 0: with whom he fabricates the emails, is only

00:55:26.340
Speaker 0: being treated as a vessel for Evan to

00:55:28.525
Speaker 0: keep lying. His mom is someone to be

00:55:30.845
Speaker 0: discarded in favour of this new surrogate family

00:55:33.805
Speaker 0: he's found for himself. Allana is left with

00:55:36.445
Speaker 0: the burden of maintaining a charity based on

00:55:39.000
Speaker 0: Evans' lies all by herself. The song is

00:55:42.120
Speaker 0: important for several reasons. For one, it's one

00:55:44.785
Speaker 0: St- the few times people's feelings other than

00:55:47.265
Speaker 0: Evan's are explicitly centred in the voice of

00:55:49.825
Speaker 0: the show. We get to see, viscerally, how

00:55:52.545
Speaker 0: Evan's restrictions are affecting other people all at

00:55:55.369
Speaker 0: once. It's a good way of showing how

00:55:57.849
Speaker 0: in deep Evan has gotten. They are Strying

00:56:00.705
Speaker 0: in this song to urge him back to

00:56:02.785
Speaker 0: doing the right thing, and it isn't working.

00:56:05.265
Speaker 0: There's even a section that shows how desperately

00:56:07.505
Speaker 0: Evan has dug himself into this hole and

00:56:09.585
Speaker 0: the fact that he doesn't really seem to

00:56:11.410
Speaker 0: want to get out of it. And it

00:56:13.090
Speaker 0: also, once again, deepens the importance of the

00:56:15.490
Speaker 0: character of Heidi. She's more than just a

00:56:17.810
Speaker 0: mom figure who exists solely to provide emotional

00:56:20.455
Speaker 0: comfort to Evan. It shows the way she

00:56:22.695
Speaker 0: is deeply affected by his actions. And even

00:56:25.655
Speaker 0: just from an Evan standpoint, St- Heidi is

00:56:27.660
Speaker 0: a very humanizing part of Evan's story. Even

00:56:31.099
Speaker 0: while he is behaving very unethically, the strong

00:56:33.980
Speaker 0: ties between Evan and his mom make Evan

00:56:35.991
Speaker 0: a more sympathetic person. It makes his breakdown,

00:56:36.082
Speaker 0: where he just needs his mom to static

00:56:37.485
Speaker 0: person. It makes his breakdown, where he just

00:56:40.205
Speaker 0: needs his mom to comfort him, where he

00:56:42.205
Speaker 0: needs a love that is unconditional, feel much

00:56:45.165
Speaker 0: more real. And to reduce Heidi to a

00:56:47.809
Speaker 0: very limited character whose only job is just

00:56:50.289
Speaker 0: to be mom and to replace everything in

00:56:52.769
Speaker 0: Good 4 U with like a stri-two minute

00:56:54.625
Speaker 0: argument scene is strongly to this show's detriment.

00:56:58.545
Speaker 0: There's also another song that they Stree technically

00:57:01.880
Speaker 0: ad toward the end, and I'll get to

00:57:04.040
Speaker 0: that one in a second because that's more

00:57:05.800
Speaker 0: of a storytelling issue than a music issue.

00:57:08.605
Speaker 0: But on the whole, the way they chose

00:57:10.365
Speaker 0: to distribute these songs, what was kept and

00:57:12.924
Speaker 0: what was cut in the story, really acted

00:57:15.005
Speaker 0: to its detriment. And I think this, and

00:57:17.820
Speaker 0: other failures to cut things properly like we

00:57:20.300
Speaker 0: saw in Into the Woods reflects an improper

00:57:23.340
Speaker 0: understanding of what a musical is and what

00:57:25.900
Speaker 0: a musical is Fundamentally Supposed TO Do. I

00:57:28.455
Speaker 0: did a whole video on this as it

00:57:29.975
Speaker 0: pertained to musical episodes of non musical TV

00:57:32.935
Speaker 0: shows, but essentially, Stream. Musical numbers are a

00:57:35.630
Speaker 0: very deliberate choice that serve a unique narrative

00:57:38.349
Speaker 0: purpose, and so you need to be equally

00:57:40.589
Speaker 0: careful and equally deliberate when cutting things out

00:57:43.365
Speaker 0: or bringing new elements in, and we very

00:57:45.925
Speaker 0: much did not get that here. In terms

00:57:48.485
Speaker 0: of musicals being much longer than their film

00:57:51.250
Speaker 0: Stranger Parts most of the time, that adaptational

00:57:53.810
Speaker 0: element also tends to demand changes to the

00:57:56.610
Speaker 0: actual story. And that's, again, just Strasseri thing.

00:58:00.545
Speaker 0: Film is a different medium and has different

00:58:02.625
Speaker 0: focus and different time constraints, so it's not

00:58:05.105
Speaker 0: necessarily a problem that, Stree was having Inez

00:58:16.165
Speaker 0: win the competition instead of Tracy. Scripting changes

00:58:18.885
Speaker 0: are natural in shows, especially when there were

00:58:21.685
Speaker 0: issues in the original or just things that

00:58:24.325
Speaker 0: wouldn't translate Street well to film. And that's

00:58:27.190
Speaker 0: the thing. Dear Evan Hansen has a lot

00:58:29.750
Speaker 0: of problems, and it's already faced a lot

00:58:32.069
Speaker 0: of criticism for how it's handled its subject

00:58:34.470
Speaker 0: matter. So the film definitely served as an

00:58:37.175
Speaker 0: opportunity to reframe some of the elements in

00:58:39.895
Speaker 0: the original that didn't necessarily work to its

00:58:42.400
Speaker 0: Advantage. And to its credit, it does try.

00:58:45.760
Speaker 0: It does attempt to reconcile with some of

00:58:48.079
Speaker 0: the more criticized parts of its stage counterpart.

00:58:51.265
Speaker 0: Unfortunately, it seems to have just worsened every

00:58:54.145
Speaker 0: single aspect of it. Stream. Beyond the omission

00:59:01.710
Speaker 0: of certain songs and the inclusion of a

00:59:03.790
Speaker 0: new one, there are other changes to the

00:59:05.925
Speaker 0: Script that are relatively minor in the grand

00:59:08.484
Speaker 0: scheme of things, but really add up. Let's

00:59:11.045
Speaker 0: just start with the most basic one. Jared,

00:59:13.765
Speaker 0: Evans' sarcastic Stree Friend is made gay in

00:59:16.760
Speaker 0: this version. This sure is a choice that

00:59:19.640
Speaker 0: is made. I'm not quite sure why it

00:59:22.200
Speaker 0: was made, beyond the fact that this was

00:59:24.165
Speaker 0: Street simply a popular headcanon for the character.

00:59:26.965
Speaker 0: There is a more cynical interpretation, which is

00:59:29.605
Speaker 0: that this was done in response to the

00:59:31.365
Speaker 0: fact that there isn't an actual canon gay

00:59:33.920
Speaker 0: character in the play, and considering how many

00:59:36.160
Speaker 0: people do think the play is about gay

00:59:38.000
Speaker 0: lovers and considering that there's an entire song

00:59:40.320
Speaker 0: that can be boiled down to essentially no

00:59:42.320
Speaker 0: homo jokes, Yeah. I could imagine it would

00:59:45.184
Speaker 0: feel weird without any sort of actual LGBTQ

00:59:48.305
Speaker 0: representation. Stream. And, yeah, Sure enough, not only

01:00:14.805
Speaker 0: is Jared gay here, but they also give

01:00:17.205
Speaker 0: him the line, but not because they're gay,

01:00:19.765
Speaker 0: which

01:00:20.940
Speaker 1: sure. Our friendship goes beyond your average kind

01:00:25.259
Speaker 1: of far, but not because they're gay.

01:00:28.859
Speaker 0: Giving the only gay character the previously no

01:00:31.895
Speaker 0: homo line is, choice. This also comes with

01:00:35.815
Speaker 0: the unintentional side effect Strip where the only

01:00:38.400
Speaker 0: known gay character in the film is the

01:00:40.880
Speaker 0: selfish jerk who openly insults Evan at every

01:00:43.680
Speaker 0: point and makes unwarranted Struments over and over

01:00:46.815
Speaker 0: again, which is also a choice. But perhaps

01:00:50.974
Speaker 0: the most blatant scripting change is to the

01:00:53.609
Speaker 0: ending. As mentioned earlier, one of the biggest

01:00:56.490
Speaker 0: issues people had with the stage version was

01:00:58.970
Speaker 0: feeling like Evan got off too easy at

01:01:01.275
Speaker 0: the end of it. But there should have

01:01:02.875
Speaker 0: been more consequences to his actions. Additionally, there's

01:01:06.714
Speaker 0: also the criticism that the stage musical isn't

01:01:09.100
Speaker 0: really about Connor and instead uses the suicide

01:01:11.900
Speaker 0: of this teenager primarily as a plot device

01:01:14.380
Speaker 0: to explore other characters. So the filmmakers decided

01:01:17.855
Speaker 0: to change the ending of the movie in

01:01:19.535
Speaker 0: order to essentially address both criticisms at the

01:01:22.255
Speaker 0: same time. And it doesn't really help, like,

01:01:25.660
Speaker 0: at all? So in the stage show, the

01:01:27.820
Speaker 0: Murphys find out about what Evan did, but

01:01:29.980
Speaker 0: they all keep it secret. Nobody else ever

01:01:32.540
Speaker 0: finds out the truth, the apple orchard fully

01:01:35.484
Speaker 0: reopens, and Zoey and Evan essentially reconcile enough

01:01:38.444
Speaker 0: to have a calm discussion about what all

01:01:40.365
Speaker 0: happened. The film tries to fix this by

01:01:42.924
Speaker 0: having Evan admit to lying about everything on

01:01:45.370
Speaker 0: his Instagram page.

01:01:47.290
Speaker 1: I was never friends with Connor Murphy. I

01:01:51.210
Speaker 1: lied Repeatedly?

01:01:54.145
Speaker 0: And then in order to hopefully gain a

01:01:56.065
Speaker 0: more accurate perspective of Connor, he messages anyone

01:01:59.105
Speaker 0: he can on Connor's Facebook page until he

01:02:01.549
Speaker 0: finds someone who went to rehab with Connor,

01:02:04.029
Speaker 0: who gives Evan a video of Connor performing

01:02:06.349
Speaker 0: a song he wrote while in the clinic.

01:02:08.625
Speaker 0: Stre- Evan then distributes a USB containing the

01:02:11.425
Speaker 0: footage to Connor's loved ones and people involved

01:02:14.225
Speaker 0: in the Connor project, and that's when we

01:02:16.465
Speaker 0: then timeskip a year later to the apple

01:02:18.890
Speaker 0: orchard conversation with Zoe and Evan. On the

01:02:21.369
Speaker 0: surface, this seems like an okay change, but

01:02:24.170
Speaker 0: in actual execution, it fixes Stree- Basically nothing.

01:02:28.095
Speaker 0: Part of the problem is that in the

01:02:29.775
Speaker 0: grand scheme of things, nothing about the ending

01:02:32.095
Speaker 0: is fundamentally different. Evan coming clean about treating

01:02:35.380
Speaker 0: is nice and all, especially if you're someone

01:02:37.140
Speaker 0: bothered by the fact that the truth never

01:02:38.740
Speaker 0: came out in the musical, but we don't

01:02:40.580
Speaker 0: ever actually see any of the consequences of

01:02:43.300
Speaker 0: Evan's revelation. Strition. Nothing substantial, at least. No

01:02:46.705
Speaker 0: deep insight into how this affects his life

01:02:49.265
Speaker 0: or changes the way people see him or

01:02:51.105
Speaker 0: treat him or anything long Sturm. They simply

01:02:53.720
Speaker 0: say that it is a thing that has

01:02:54.920
Speaker 0: now happened. And the rest of the ending

01:02:57.080
Speaker 0: plays out as normal, with Zoe still forgiving

01:02:59.320
Speaker 0: Evan and the apple orchard still opening. It

01:03:01.835
Speaker 0: feels like a change there not because they

01:03:03.835
Speaker 0: want to explore that idea of What if

01:03:06.075
Speaker 0: Evan came clean to everyone? But because they

01:03:08.395
Speaker 0: want people to be able to cross off

01:03:10.075
Speaker 0: the list and say, Yep, That happened. He

01:03:12.570
Speaker 0: did finally reveal himself. As for the Connor

01:03:15.290
Speaker 0: stuff, once again, this seems like an okay

01:03:17.930
Speaker 0: change on Streamer. It's trying to adjust the

01:03:20.515
Speaker 0: ending to be more about Connor and focus

01:03:22.515
Speaker 0: on the actual person at the end of

01:03:24.195
Speaker 0: the day. Showing stuff that was only mentioned

01:03:26.595
Speaker 0: in the show, like Evan finding a list

01:03:28.580
Speaker 0: of Connor's favourite books and going through them

01:03:30.740
Speaker 0: to understand him better is a good call.

01:03:33.220
Speaker 0: Even if it does mean watching Evan read

01:03:35.140
Speaker 0: Ready Player 1 to understand a studkid, but

01:03:38.055
Speaker 0: it just, like, rings so hollow. The new

01:03:41.335
Speaker 0: song they gave to Connor a little closer

01:03:43.655
Speaker 0: is, Stream. Sorry if this makes me come

01:03:46.150
Speaker 0: off poorly but it's really bad. It's a

01:03:48.390
Speaker 0: really generic song. It tells us nothing about

01:03:51.030
Speaker 0: him as a person or anything that makes

01:03:53.109
Speaker 0: him unique. Just this Str standard inspirational acoustic

01:03:56.535
Speaker 0: guitar piece fresh out of a Baptist youth

01:03:58.775
Speaker 0: sermon. And the thing is that despite this

01:04:07.579
Speaker 0: attempt, the movie is weirdly even less about

01:04:10.140
Speaker 0: Connor than the stage show is. Stre- Like,

01:04:12.375
Speaker 0: Connor in the musical gets a fair bit

01:04:14.615
Speaker 0: more to do than the film. As previously

01:04:17.095
Speaker 0: mentioned, we have the opening number, which gives

01:04:19.335
Speaker 0: us a glimpse into Connor's home life, St-

01:04:29.244
Speaker 0: Striped a view of what Connor's day to

01:04:30.845
Speaker 0: day life was like while he was still

01:04:32.685
Speaker 0: around. But then even after Connor dies, he

01:04:35.405
Speaker 0: still manages to stick around for the rest

01:04:37.484
Speaker 0: of the time. I don't know if there's

01:04:39.040
Speaker 0: a better way to phrase this except to

01:04:40.880
Speaker 0: say that metaphorically, Connor's ghost basically acts as

01:04:44.640
Speaker 0: Evan's subconscious throughout the stage show, occasionally shopping

01:04:48.275
Speaker 0: up to ask him ethical questions and challenge

01:04:50.434
Speaker 0: him on what he's doing and do a

01:04:52.035
Speaker 0: reprise of Sincerely Me about sex acts you

01:04:54.595
Speaker 0: do in Strib. Because, like, what's the point

01:04:56.730
Speaker 0: of having a whole actor for Connor and

01:04:58.490
Speaker 0: just having him for the first 15 minutes

01:05:00.410
Speaker 0: of the show? You gotta get your money's

01:05:02.410
Speaker 0: worth. Keep bringing the kid out on stage

01:05:05.475
Speaker 0: even if he's dead. I mean, to be

01:05:07.235
Speaker 0: fair, they did the same thing in Heather's.

01:05:08.915
Speaker 0: She just fucking dies in the movie because

01:05:10.995
Speaker 0: it's Film, you can just tell your actor

01:05:12.670
Speaker 0: to go home but in the musical, she

01:05:14.670
Speaker 0: pops up as a ghost. She's Veronica's conscience.

01:05:18.485
Speaker 0: You do that. You do that on stage.

01:05:20.725
Speaker 0: Classic difference of mediums. I hit my mic.

01:05:23.845
Speaker 0: But in all seriousness, what this means is

01:05:26.165
Speaker 0: that even though we're not Stream, seeing the

01:05:28.039
Speaker 0: actual Connor in life and in action and

01:05:30.279
Speaker 0: we are seeing Evan's internal conception of Connor,

01:05:33.079
Speaker 0: his presence is still felt throughout the show.

01:05:36.015
Speaker 0: Whenever he shows up again, it's a reminder

01:05:38.175
Speaker 0: that, yes, this is who this whole thing

01:05:39.935
Speaker 0: is about. This is the kid who's getting

01:05:42.480
Speaker 0: St Lost in the lying and the chaos.

01:05:45.119
Speaker 0: The movie drops this entirely. I get why.

01:05:47.920
Speaker 0: Having scenes where Connor's ghost Stripeers and challenges

01:05:50.925
Speaker 0: Evan would be super weird to show on

01:05:53.165
Speaker 0: screen, and would also probably pad out the

01:05:55.805
Speaker 0: screentime too much. Strict. But what this means

01:05:58.800
Speaker 0: is that after his brief scene in the

01:06:00.720
Speaker 0: library and then the musical number Sincerely Me,

01:06:03.760
Speaker 0: Connor just disappears from the show. St- People

01:06:06.775
Speaker 0: talk about him, sure, but we don't really

01:06:08.935
Speaker 0: see him nor do we get a lot

01:06:10.455
Speaker 0: of interesting details about him or a sense

01:06:13.015
Speaker 0: of who he is. The way they feature

01:06:14.935
Speaker 0: Connor in the film, he might as well

01:06:16.590
Speaker 0: have just been a lamp that broke and

01:06:18.270
Speaker 0: shattered that everyone is now sad about. That's

01:06:20.910
Speaker 0: why this changed ending with the new song

01:06:23.630
Speaker 0: rings so hollow. They took out a significant

01:06:26.725
Speaker 0: portion of this character's presence and identity from

01:06:29.445
Speaker 0: the show and replaced it with a generic

01:06:31.605
Speaker 0: acoustic radio hit. And it's a reminder that

01:06:34.230
Speaker 0: at the end of the day, this movie

01:06:35.750
Speaker 0: actually isn't about Connor because the ending wasn't

01:06:38.470
Speaker 0: changed to place more emphasis on him, but

01:06:40.630
Speaker 0: rather to create more of a redemption arc

01:06:42.805
Speaker 0: for Evan. Even in the revision, this film

01:06:45.045
Speaker 0: is still prioritizing Evan's emotions in Journey rather

01:06:48.085
Speaker 0: than Connor's, and it makes the whole thing

01:06:50.085
Speaker 0: feel significantly scummier. It makes the film feel

01:06:53.590
Speaker 0: less like it's trying to tell the story

01:06:55.510
Speaker 0: of Dear Evan Hansen and more like the

01:06:57.590
Speaker 0: film is supposed to be an apology for

01:06:59.750
Speaker 0: the story of Dear in Hanson. But not

01:07:02.045
Speaker 0: even a good apology, one of those ones

01:07:04.125
Speaker 0: where someone is like, I am very sorry

01:07:06.365
Speaker 0: if you were offended by my Shards. The

01:07:08.660
Speaker 0: way that the film is written, the changes

01:07:10.420
Speaker 0: and alterations it makes to the source material,

01:07:12.580
Speaker 0: which already had issues to begin with, makes

01:07:15.395
Speaker 0: Stream. The film seem way more hollow and

01:07:17.235
Speaker 0: way more mean and impersonal than its stage

01:07:19.875
Speaker 0: counterpart. But hey, you know, just because the

01:07:22.195
Speaker 0: script is shitty doesn't mean that the movie

01:07:24.115
Speaker 0: can't be Strud. Lots of shitty scripts can

01:07:26.460
Speaker 0: be saved through execution and good direction, especially

01:07:29.740
Speaker 0: musicals. So, How good is Evan Hansen's directing?

01:07:39.089
Speaker 0: Perhaps one of the most important parts of

01:07:41.010
Speaker 0: a stage to screen conversion is one of

01:07:43.089
Speaker 0: the ones that you don't really think about.

01:07:45.089
Speaker 0: And admittedly, that's because most people don't think

01:07:47.569
Speaker 0: about it in general. Cinematography, staging, and blocking

01:07:50.835
Speaker 0: are some of the great invisible magics of

01:07:53.235
Speaker 0: the art form. Things like acting and music

01:07:56.115
Speaker 0: and dialogue are all flashy and in your

01:07:58.410
Speaker 0: face. They're things you can easily notice and

01:08:01.210
Speaker 0: observe and comment on regardless of your knowledge

01:08:03.690
Speaker 0: of the medium or any greater theory. It's

01:08:06.205
Speaker 0: pretty easy to tell how a certain casting

01:08:08.445
Speaker 0: choice affects the film, or if a song

01:08:10.525
Speaker 0: is performed well, or if a line of

01:08:12.365
Speaker 0: dialogue is good or bad. But generally speaking,

01:08:15.440
Speaker 0: things like blocking and cinematography are sort of

01:08:18.399
Speaker 0: meant to be invisible. Unless something is actively

01:08:21.359
Speaker 0: trying to be noticeable, chances are, you aren't

01:08:23.875
Speaker 0: Stream going to notice, the same way you

01:08:25.475
Speaker 0: might not notice exactly what you're doing with

01:08:27.234
Speaker 0: your hands in a certain moment, or where

01:08:29.154
Speaker 0: you are relative to the door in your

01:08:30.915
Speaker 0: room. It's also the moment where a st-

01:08:33.210
Speaker 0: A lot of movie musicals really really mess

01:08:35.410
Speaker 0: up, especially recently. You see, as we've kind

01:08:38.449
Speaker 0: of talked about throughout the video, film and

01:08:40.689
Speaker 0: theatre are 2 different mediums and by extension

01:08:43.415
Speaker 0: have 2 different languages. Things that work on

01:08:46.055
Speaker 0: stage won't necessarily work on screen, and vice

01:08:48.854
Speaker 0: versa. Stree- a lot of this is a

01:08:50.969
Speaker 0: difference in perceived realism. In a stage production,

01:08:54.010
Speaker 0: you don't necessarily need to believe that the

01:08:56.250
Speaker 0: space people are occupying is a real Space

01:08:58.854
Speaker 0: because, well, you'd know it's not. You're there

01:09:01.495
Speaker 0: observing a performance. You are watching people perform

01:09:04.455
Speaker 0: in a box in front of you. They

01:09:06.550
Speaker 0: exist in the same physical space that you

01:09:08.710
Speaker 0: do. That means that a lot of the

01:09:10.469
Speaker 0: staging and production of stage shows are more

01:09:13.270
Speaker 0: abstract, I guess the best word. They can

01:09:15.594
Speaker 0: play around more with the environment, such as

01:09:17.594
Speaker 0: how Hamilton's set is a mostly static wooden

01:09:20.474
Speaker 0: room with a few props every now and

01:09:22.640
Speaker 0: then. You can play with time, like having

01:09:24.880
Speaker 0: a character finish one scene and then transition

01:09:27.199
Speaker 0: into another scene without that character leaving the

01:09:29.520
Speaker 0: stage at all or anything else that would

01:09:31.279
Speaker 0: give the Theoretical idea of a scene ending.

01:09:33.905
Speaker 0: Think of how Come From Away has most

01:09:35.745
Speaker 0: of its cast on stage for the entirety

01:09:37.825
Speaker 0: of its show and just transitions effortlessly between

01:09:40.545
Speaker 0: moment to moment. Stream. But I think one

01:09:42.560
Speaker 0: of the most important things unique to theatre

01:09:44.640
Speaker 0: is the way that a character interacts with

01:09:46.880
Speaker 0: the 4th wall. The 4th wall thing is

01:09:48.995
Speaker 0: stri- quite interesting because it's a small matter

01:09:51.314
Speaker 0: that really does have a large effect on

01:09:53.314
Speaker 0: the overall perception of the work. For those

01:09:55.635
Speaker 0: who don't know, the 4th wall mall in

01:09:57.550
Speaker 0: a stage production refers to the 4th wall

01:10:00.030
Speaker 0: that would exist in a set. Considering how

01:10:02.350
Speaker 0: theater has to be observable and cheated out

01:10:04.670
Speaker 0: toward an audience, Stree. Rooms can't be closed

01:10:07.265
Speaker 0: and contained the same way they are in

01:10:09.105
Speaker 0: real life. So a room in a stage

01:10:11.105
Speaker 0: show has a back wall, 2 St sidewalls

01:10:13.480
Speaker 0: and nothing else. What would be the 4th

01:10:15.640
Speaker 0: wall is the audience. And in a stage

01:10:17.880
Speaker 0: show, you can easily play with that. Because

01:10:20.120
Speaker 0: there is avoidable perception that this is all

01:10:22.635
Speaker 0: being performed to a crowd, you can simply

01:10:25.115
Speaker 0: have your actors, well, perform to the crowd.

01:10:27.915
Speaker 0: I don't necessarily mean direct interactions, like calling

01:10:30.715
Speaker 0: out Strip to them or mingling with them

01:10:32.219
Speaker 0: the way a musician might at a concert

01:10:35.980
Speaker 0: But it's more that because of the fact

01:10:37.739
Speaker 0: that you're aware you're being performed to, the

01:10:40.055
Speaker 0: actor, if they wanted to, could just stand

01:10:42.295
Speaker 0: there and, well, perform to you. No need

01:10:45.095
Speaker 0: for a lot of stage business, or sometimes

01:10:47.255
Speaker 0: even a background. Strand, you can just have

01:10:49.200
Speaker 0: the characters sing to the crowd amongst an

01:10:51.200
Speaker 0: empty backdrop and you're fine and it gets

01:10:53.360
Speaker 0: the job done and it works. But that

01:10:55.840
Speaker 0: doesn't work in film. Not really. The problem

01:10:59.025
Speaker 0: is that while the 4th wall in a

01:11:00.785
Speaker 0: stage show is the audience, the 4th wall

01:11:03.025
Speaker 0: in a film is the camera, and then

01:11:05.185
Speaker 0: later the audience will watch what the camera

01:11:07.340
Speaker 0: captured. And because of our underlying notion of

01:11:10.060
Speaker 0: cameras and how they work and what their

01:11:11.740
Speaker 0: purpose is, we generally expect them to record

01:11:14.380
Speaker 0: something matching close to reality. I don't mean

01:11:17.085
Speaker 0: that we expect everything that we see on

01:11:19.005
Speaker 0: film to actually be capable of happening in

01:11:21.485
Speaker 0: real life. Like, it's not like we're all

01:11:23.565
Speaker 0: watching Dune and going, this is bullshit. Shit.

01:11:26.380
Speaker 0: Worms aren't actually that big. However, there is

01:11:29.260
Speaker 0: this sort of idea that what we're seeing

01:11:31.179
Speaker 0: in frame is something that exists in the

01:11:33.179
Speaker 0: world of that Stream, and the world of

01:11:35.264
Speaker 0: that frame needs to seem like enough of

01:11:37.025
Speaker 0: a believable world to us. It's generally why

01:11:39.824
Speaker 0: you don't see as much distraction in film

01:11:41.880
Speaker 0: as you do in theatre, at least outside

01:11:43.719
Speaker 0: of art films. It's also why effects and

01:11:46.199
Speaker 0: props tend to get called out for not

01:11:48.285
Speaker 0: looking realistic more in film than they do

01:11:50.605
Speaker 0: in theater. Unless it's like that weird bone

01:11:53.245
Speaker 0: saw inflatable that they used in Spider Man

01:11:55.645
Speaker 0: Turn Off the Dark. What the fuck was

01:11:57.200
Speaker 0: that? The ways in which the language of

01:11:59.040
Speaker 0: the two mediums differ is honestly the root

01:12:01.360
Speaker 0: cause for a lot of the adaptational issues

01:12:03.680
Speaker 0: that you see in a lot of terrible

01:12:05.440
Speaker 0: musical movies. If there's any style of theatre

01:12:08.065
Speaker 0: that takes full advantage of the abstract nature

01:12:10.385
Speaker 0: of the stage, it's musicals. And trying to

01:12:12.545
Speaker 0: figure out how to convert that into a

01:12:14.224
Speaker 0: film with different standards and understandings of how

01:12:16.870
Speaker 0: everything should be presented is challenging. One of

01:12:19.989
Speaker 0: the ways this difference manifests itself, and a

01:12:22.390
Speaker 0: way in which It's especially noticeable in Dear

01:12:24.445
Speaker 0: Evan Hansen is the way both stories convey

01:12:26.925
Speaker 0: the passage of time. The stage musical really

01:12:29.565
Speaker 0: wants to make it clear to the audience

01:12:31.244
Speaker 0: that Evan's lie, at least at the beginning

01:12:33.950
Speaker 0: wasn't really something he deliberately set out to

01:12:36.510
Speaker 0: create. It was him not wanting to speak

01:12:39.070
Speaker 0: up in an awkward situation and correct a

01:12:41.630
Speaker 0: pair of grieving parents, Strings, and then it

01:12:43.665
Speaker 0: snowballed out of control from there. And one

01:12:46.065
Speaker 0: of the things this show does do well

01:12:47.825
Speaker 0: is to convey the passage of time. Stree

01:12:50.150
Speaker 0: Sets and characters often move around Evan, who

01:12:52.950
Speaker 0: is the centerpiece, so once he's finished keeping

01:12:55.350
Speaker 0: up one aspect of his ruse, he's immediately

01:12:57.510
Speaker 0: onto the next String. Evan is spending time

01:12:59.885
Speaker 0: with Zoe, and then immediately afterward, Alana is

01:13:02.445
Speaker 0: urging him to keep sharing his email exchanges

01:13:04.685
Speaker 0: with Connor. Stree. Or Evan is with his

01:13:06.820
Speaker 0: mom Heidi and then the world moves around

01:13:08.820
Speaker 0: him and immediately he's back visiting the Murphy

01:13:11.460
Speaker 0: family again, living in the temporary lie stri

01:13:14.435
Speaker 0: of a supportive, wealthy nuclear family. In a

01:13:17.474
Speaker 0: lot of ways, this conveys the exact same

01:13:19.875
Speaker 0: feeling Evan has: that he has no control

01:13:22.675
Speaker 0: over his life, that things to him. But

01:13:25.670
Speaker 0: in the film, that sense of momentum is

01:13:27.830
Speaker 0: no longer present. Characters and sets can't just

01:13:31.030
Speaker 0: move around Evan to keep stre- that feeling

01:13:33.381
Speaker 0: of constant pressure and snowballing. Instead, when we

01:13:35.773
Speaker 0: keep cutting to him going from his house

01:13:38.164
Speaker 0: to school to the Murphy home, it becomes

01:13:40.555
Speaker 0: a lot more grounded in TrueMinds and a

01:13:42.849
Speaker 0: lot more clear to us that, like, this

01:13:44.929
Speaker 0: sense of constant action happening to Evan isn't

01:13:47.809
Speaker 0: really what we're seeing here. There are long

01:13:50.465
Speaker 0: stretches of time between the things Evan does,

01:13:53.025
Speaker 0: and he keeps just choosing to go over

01:13:55.744
Speaker 0: and hang out at the Murphys when really

01:13:57.744
Speaker 0: he could stop at any time. Along with

01:14:00.110
Speaker 0: the casting and along with the musical changes

01:14:02.590
Speaker 0: and along with the scripting changes, this is

01:14:04.350
Speaker 0: yet another reason we find it extremely difficult

01:14:06.805
Speaker 0: to relate to and sympathize with Evan and

01:14:08.885
Speaker 0: another reason why he comes off as a

01:14:10.565
Speaker 0: fucking serial killer. The heightened dramatic, very metaphorical

01:14:14.420
Speaker 0: attention around time and how Evan responds to

01:14:16.900
Speaker 0: it can't really work on film in the

01:14:18.980
Speaker 0: same way that it does on stage. Which

01:14:21.060
Speaker 0: means, when you're adapting it, if you wanna

01:14:22.965
Speaker 0: convey that same feeling of things just snowballing

01:14:25.605
Speaker 0: out of control, you need to make certain

01:14:27.925
Speaker 0: changes to the way it's directed or what

01:14:30.005
Speaker 0: exactly happens in it in order to translate

01:14:32.270
Speaker 0: that feeling to a more grounded medium. But

01:14:34.670
Speaker 0: by and large, dear Evan Hansen just doesn't

01:14:37.150
Speaker 0: do that, and so we end up watching

01:14:38.910
Speaker 0: and judging Evan a lot more harshly

01:14:39.995
Speaker 1: than we would when we see him

01:14:40.100
Speaker 0: on stage. This is a challenge directors face

01:14:40.685
Speaker 0: than we would when we see him on

01:14:42.285
Speaker 0: stage. This is a challenge directors face a

01:14:44.765
Speaker 0: lot when they're trying to translate metaphorical or

01:14:47.565
Speaker 0: simplified versions of a staged Story onto screen.

01:14:50.909
Speaker 0: You can't necessarily create the same non literal

01:14:53.949
Speaker 0: visual shorthand as you can on stage, but

01:14:56.585
Speaker 0: at the same time, too much realism can

01:14:58.585
Speaker 0: actually weaken what a story is trying to

01:15:00.585
Speaker 0: do. I think the perfect example of this

01:15:02.745
Speaker 0: in action is The Last 5 Years. Stri-

01:15:05.020
Speaker 0: For those who don't know, The Last 5

01:15:06.540
Speaker 0: Years is a semi autobiographical musical by Twitter

01:15:09.740
Speaker 0: name searcher Jason Robert Brown chronicling the relationship

01:15:13.020
Speaker 0: and eventual breakup stri-two people: Jamie, a self

01:15:16.735
Speaker 0: absorbed asshole writer, and Kathy, a woman with

01:15:20.015
Speaker 0: anxiety and insecurity Issues who needs more time

01:15:22.900
Speaker 0: and respect than what Jamie is willing to

01:15:24.739
Speaker 0: provide to her because he just didn't listen

01:15:26.340
Speaker 0: to anything and always put his needs before

01:15:28.395
Speaker 0: Str- Hers and Sorry, sorry. My co writer

01:15:31.115
Speaker 0: Emily went through a breakup while writing this

01:15:33.275
Speaker 0: script. I don't know if you can tell.

01:15:35.275
Speaker 0: There are 2 things that make The Last

01:15:36.715
Speaker 0: 5 Years stand out. The first being that

01:15:38.680
Speaker 0: it's told from a nonlinear perspective. Jamie's side

01:15:41.640
Speaker 0: of the story is told in chronological order,

01:15:44.360
Speaker 0: starting with the two meeting and ending with

01:15:46.085
Speaker 0: him leaving her, while Cathy's side of the

01:15:48.165
Speaker 0: story is told in reverse, starting with Jamie

01:15:50.645
Speaker 0: leaving her and ending with the 2 meeting

01:15:52.485
Speaker 0: for the first time. The second thing that

01:15:54.245
Speaker 0: makes stand out is, well, the fact that

01:15:56.040
Speaker 0: it's even split up into 2 sides to

01:15:58.040
Speaker 0: begin with. With the exception of one number

01:16:00.360
Speaker 0: toward the middle, where the 2 stories Stream

01:16:02.235
Speaker 0: sync up chronologically, Jamie and Kathy are never

01:16:04.875
Speaker 0: on stage at the same time. Essentially all

01:16:07.595
Speaker 0: the songs are solos, there is no ensemble,

01:16:10.155
Speaker 0: just one of the on stage singing about

01:16:12.350
Speaker 0: the relationship, and then when they're done, they

01:16:14.270
Speaker 0: tag out and the other actor comes in

01:16:16.190
Speaker 0: to do their song. This is important to

01:16:18.270
Speaker 0: the way the last 5 years feels. For

01:16:20.735
Speaker 0: starters, it contributes to the feeling of disconnect

01:16:23.215
Speaker 0: between Jamie and Kathy. Considering how the musical

01:16:26.094
Speaker 0: starts with the revelation that these two won't

01:16:28.415
Speaker 0: actually end up together, Having them have limited

01:16:30.830
Speaker 0: onstage interaction takes away a lot of feelings

01:16:33.630
Speaker 0: of intimacy the couple could have, and I

01:16:35.550
Speaker 0: mean that in the best of ways. It

01:16:37.790
Speaker 0: makes it Strictly Clear, not just through the

01:16:40.255
Speaker 0: lyrics themselves but via the physical presentation of

01:16:43.375
Speaker 0: them, that there is an intense split and

01:16:45.615
Speaker 0: difference in how the to experience things. And

01:16:48.530
Speaker 0: that's another reason it works so well. By

01:16:50.850
Speaker 0: dividing the 2 characters up, making it so

01:16:52.850
Speaker 0: that only one of them sings to the

01:16:54.450
Speaker 0: audience at Stream, it reinforces the idea that

01:16:57.235
Speaker 0: what you're being presented is simply the perspective

01:16:59.635
Speaker 0: of the person singing at the time, rather

01:17:01.795
Speaker 0: than the actual objective truth of what was

01:17:03.875
Speaker 0: going on. Stream. Theoretically speaking, the point of

01:17:06.600
Speaker 0: the last 5 years is that by showing

01:17:08.840
Speaker 0: how each person saw the good and bad

01:17:11.320
Speaker 0: parts of that relationship, you understand both people's

01:17:14.485
Speaker 0: Strengths and Flaws, and also how they both

01:17:16.805
Speaker 0: contributed to the marriage not working. I stay

01:17:19.605
Speaker 0: theoretically. Jamie does a lot more blatantly terrible

01:17:22.885
Speaker 0: things throughout Str Show, which are easier to

01:17:24.730
Speaker 0: point to and go, Yeah, that's pretty fucked

01:17:26.889
Speaker 0: up. But for the most part, it does

01:17:29.130
Speaker 0: work out. Kathy will sing about frustrations with

01:17:32.425
Speaker 0: career and feeling like Jamie is neglecting her

01:17:34.905
Speaker 0: and her interests, and then Jamie will come

01:17:36.745
Speaker 0: and sing about how hard it is to

01:17:38.265
Speaker 0: try and support her and be hit with

01:17:39.945
Speaker 0: a brick wall. Kathy will sing about how

01:17:42.590
Speaker 0: Jamie's success makes him too busy and makes

01:17:44.910
Speaker 0: her feel neglected, while Jamie will sing about

01:17:47.310
Speaker 0: how stressful School trying to manage being a

01:17:49.525
Speaker 0: successful author is, and how terrible it can

01:17:52.325
Speaker 0: feel to have his wife seemingly judge him

01:17:54.645
Speaker 0: for trying to advance his career. It's some

01:17:57.480
Speaker 0: honestly really interesting stuff, and despite some flaws

01:18:00.280
Speaker 0: and warts, The Last 5 Years is generally

01:18:02.600
Speaker 0: a good stage Show, and I do recommend

01:18:04.975
Speaker 0: checking it out. But then in 2014, they

01:18:07.295
Speaker 0: decided to do a movie adaptation of it

01:18:09.535
Speaker 0: for some reason. The film, starring Anna Hendrick

01:18:12.679
Speaker 0: and Jeremy Jordan showcases a lot of the

01:18:14.840
Speaker 0: issues that come up with translating a work

01:18:16.920
Speaker 0: like this to film. And the thing that

01:18:18.760
Speaker 0: makes it so interesting is that there really

01:18:20.599
Speaker 0: isn't anything garish Strictly bad with the directing

01:18:23.275
Speaker 0: choices. Yeah, there's a few things here and

01:18:25.435
Speaker 0: there that I can nitpick about, such as

01:18:27.034
Speaker 0: the way they did Nobody Needs to Know,

01:18:28.635
Speaker 0: but overall this isn't something like a Tom

01:18:30.520
Speaker 0: Hooper situation where it's just piles and piles

01:18:33.159
Speaker 0: of terrible decisions. Generally speaking, the directing is

01:18:36.679
Speaker 0: fine. The camera choices are a good fit

01:18:39.335
Speaker 0: for what they're going for. The switch between

01:18:41.655
Speaker 0: timelines and perspectives is made as clear as

01:18:44.295
Speaker 0: you could in film. The musical numbers are

01:18:46.420
Speaker 0: done with the energy that you'd want to

01:18:47.940
Speaker 0: have. There's no real egregious, oh, you decided

01:18:51.140
Speaker 0: to do this scene this way moment? But

01:18:53.780
Speaker 0: yet the film just doesn't really work, and

01:18:56.235
Speaker 0: the reason why it doesn't work feels less

01:18:58.195
Speaker 0: because of any particularly bad choices and more

01:19:00.994
Speaker 0: just the differences in the medium. Stream. Because

01:19:03.270
Speaker 0: once again, we go back to that difference

01:19:05.270
Speaker 0: in the abstract versus literal. On stage, you

01:19:08.550
Speaker 0: can get away with only 2 actors splitting

01:19:11.225
Speaker 0: time on stage in a set that's just

01:19:13.065
Speaker 0: a single table and a bookshelf. But that

01:19:15.465
Speaker 0: wouldn't really work in a film. If you

01:19:17.865
Speaker 0: tried that, it would feel too experimental, and

01:19:20.260
Speaker 0: too much like you just pointed a camera

01:19:22.020
Speaker 0: at a stage show. And the more complicated

01:19:24.340
Speaker 0: your set design gets, the weirder and more

01:19:26.500
Speaker 0: awkward it's going to feel to have a

01:19:28.020
Speaker 0: single actor belt a number Stream in it

01:19:29.915
Speaker 0: without anybody else present, especially if the song

01:19:32.614
Speaker 0: is theoretically being sung to someone. So because

01:19:35.895
Speaker 0: of this, the movie basically disregards the only

01:19:38.775
Speaker 0: one actor on stage at a time setup.

01:19:41.480
Speaker 0: Both of them are on screen together for

01:19:43.800
Speaker 0: a large part of the movie. There's a

01:19:45.960
Speaker 0: whole bunch of extras in each scene now,

01:19:48.119
Speaker 0: and in general, the Film is shot and

01:19:50.235
Speaker 0: staged, much like a conventional movie. This should

01:19:53.195
Speaker 0: theoretically make the show work better as a

01:19:55.435
Speaker 0: film, but no. Not really. It's honestly a

01:19:59.150
Speaker 0: lot more awkward. The film didn't really make

01:20:01.789
Speaker 0: any real changes to the script or lyrics

01:20:04.270
Speaker 0: or any of the songs. Nothing substantial, released,

01:20:07.114
Speaker 0: they're all still written as basically solos meant

01:20:09.994
Speaker 0: to be performed more at air than at

01:20:12.394
Speaker 0: living people. And because they're now being performed

01:20:15.114
Speaker 0: at other characters rather than at air, you

01:20:17.760
Speaker 0: get these honestly sort of uncomfortable scenes where

01:20:20.440
Speaker 0: a person will be singing to the other

01:20:22.079
Speaker 0: actor who has no choice to just sit

01:20:24.515
Speaker 0: there and watch and try to come up

01:20:26.195
Speaker 0: with proper facial reactions. They did add some

01:20:28.995
Speaker 0: bonus dialogue to help balance it out and

01:20:30.995
Speaker 0: make it feel less one Stranded, but it

01:20:33.060
Speaker 0: still sticks out really really poorly. The end

01:20:35.380
Speaker 0: result is a film that didn't do anything

01:20:37.540
Speaker 0: egregiously wrong, but still feels like a significant

01:20:40.554
Speaker 0: downgrade over its stage version. Even if you

01:20:43.275
Speaker 0: don't mind the strange way the songs play

01:20:45.514
Speaker 0: out in the film, losing the uniqueness of

01:20:47.675
Speaker 0: the one person at a time Staging does

01:20:49.690
Speaker 0: ruin a lot of the show's impact. It

01:20:51.770
Speaker 0: changes the way you see the 2 characters.

01:20:54.010
Speaker 0: It changes the way you see the 2

01:20:55.610
Speaker 0: events Streamfold. In the play, what you're supposed

01:20:57.995
Speaker 0: to be seeing is a biased, one-sided perspective,

01:21:01.195
Speaker 0: and the staging reinforced that. But the film

01:21:03.835
Speaker 0: being shot more conventionally means that, theoretically, you're

01:21:06.730
Speaker 0: seeing an objective, reliable perspective. It really breaks

01:21:10.250
Speaker 0: a lot of what the play is going

01:21:11.665
Speaker 0: Stream and what makes it so unique in

01:21:13.345
Speaker 0: the first place, and it's not necessarily because

01:21:15.825
Speaker 0: of directorial choices but rather just because the

01:21:17.985
Speaker 0: medium is so different that I can't imagine

01:21:20.225
Speaker 0: the Strip's 5 years working onscreen at all

01:21:22.460
Speaker 0: without it just being essentially a recording of

01:21:24.860
Speaker 0: the stage show. And honestly, what we can

01:21:27.420
Speaker 0: take away from the Stream. The last 5

01:21:29.603
Speaker 0: years' problems being adapted to film can be

01:21:31.840
Speaker 0: applied pretty easily to Dear Evan Hansen, because

01:21:34.076
Speaker 0: it also struggles with this. The difference being

01:21:36.313
Speaker 0: that the issues are less because of the

01:21:38.390
Speaker 0: format of the musical and legit just the

01:21:40.470
Speaker 0: direction being overall pretty shit. Dear Evan Hansen

01:21:43.990
Speaker 0: is a lot more conventional of a stage

01:21:46.310
Speaker 0: show than the last 5 years. It follows

01:21:48.795
Speaker 0: the standard beats you'd expect from a stage

01:21:51.035
Speaker 0: musical. Opening number, brief scene of dialogue, next

01:21:54.075
Speaker 0: musical number, that's an I want songs, scene

01:21:56.010
Speaker 0: of dialogue, musical number, dialogue, ensemble number, etc.

01:22:00.010
Speaker 0: There's nothing about the way Dear Evan Hansen

01:22:02.409
Speaker 0: is Structured that makes it significantly different than

01:22:05.175
Speaker 0: your average Disney musical when you get down

01:22:07.175
Speaker 0: to it. So translating it to film wouldn't

01:22:09.815
Speaker 0: necessarily be Stree- Easy, but it isn't impossible.

01:22:13.159
Speaker 0: But oh god, talk about making essentially every

01:22:16.280
Speaker 0: wrong choice you possibly could. Strud, there's been

01:22:19.225
Speaker 0: this recent trend of musical movies that are

01:22:21.785
Speaker 0: seemingly ashamed to be musical movies, made by

01:22:25.225
Speaker 0: directors who don't really understand the genre or

01:22:28.060
Speaker 0: how to film it. Tom Hooper's Les Mis

01:22:30.620
Speaker 0: wasn't the first film to fall under this

01:22:32.380
Speaker 0: category, but it's certainly the most notable. Stroll.

01:22:35.015
Speaker 0: Films in this category are generally made by

01:22:37.495
Speaker 0: prestige slash award centric directors who will say

01:22:40.455
Speaker 0: that they're trying to approach the musical with

01:22:42.650
Speaker 0: Stream, which just, no. Like, even the most

01:22:46.650
Speaker 0: downbeat of musicals is larger than life. The

01:22:49.690
Speaker 0: basis of this style itself involves people feeling

01:22:52.525
Speaker 0: so much emotion that they have to sing

01:22:54.525
Speaker 0: about it. Saying you wanna make a grounded

01:22:56.925
Speaker 0: and realistic musical is like saying you wanna

01:22:59.360
Speaker 0: make a subdued opera or a good video

01:23:02.000
Speaker 0: game music cover band. It's a fundamental misunderstanding

01:23:05.520
Speaker 0: of what material you're working with. And yes,

01:23:07.875
Speaker 0: it is true that Dear Evan Hansen is

01:23:09.715
Speaker 0: more grounded than a lot of its stage

01:23:11.475
Speaker 0: contemporaries. This isn't a Hadestown or even a

01:23:14.275
Speaker 0: Hamilton. There's no elaborate dance sequences or complex

01:23:17.720
Speaker 0: musicality. Like I said before, it's basically your

01:23:20.600
Speaker 0: standard musical set straight up of dialogue followed

01:23:23.135
Speaker 0: by song followed by dialogue, and the world

01:23:25.295
Speaker 0: itself is meant to be as close to

01:23:26.895
Speaker 0: our modern day world and the songs are

01:23:28.870
Speaker 0: pretty much a standard pop affair with no

01:23:30.790
Speaker 0: real big showstoppers. But like, even then, there

01:23:33.910
Speaker 0: still needs to be some attempt at making

01:23:35.965
Speaker 0: the music numbers via staging and blocking not

01:23:38.445
Speaker 0: be bad. Theoretically speaking, the way you would

01:23:41.805
Speaker 0: shoot and block and film a musical

01:23:43.270
Speaker 1: scene is going to be significantly different than

01:23:43.472
Speaker 1: the way you'd just do a normal one.

01:23:43.675
Speaker 0: A musical number is differently than the way

01:23:46.440
Speaker 0: you'd just do a normal one. A musical

01:23:48.679
Speaker 0: number is a break from the reality of

01:23:50.679
Speaker 0: the world, leaving realism behind and prioritizing rhythm.

01:23:54.455
Speaker 0: So okay. Let's take In the Heights, the

01:23:56.615
Speaker 0: movie, as a good recent example of this.

01:23:59.495
Speaker 0: In the Heights isn't a perfect film, and

01:24:01.895
Speaker 0: I do have some issues with it, mainly

01:24:03.620
Speaker 0: the deviations from the original stage play and

01:24:05.940
Speaker 0: the complete gutting of Nina and Benny's storyline.

01:24:08.740
Speaker 0: But god did it feel good to watch

01:24:10.740
Speaker 0: a recent musical Stream that didn't absolutely hate

01:24:14.165
Speaker 0: being a musical. In the Heights is admittedly

01:24:17.285
Speaker 0: a way more over the top show than

01:24:19.445
Speaker 0: Evan Hansen. It's a musical fan's musical. It's

01:24:22.740
Speaker 0: made to have a large ensemble and have

01:24:25.140
Speaker 0: grand, elaborate dance scenes and a million show

01:24:28.475
Speaker 0: stopping numbers. So obviously the cinematography is going

01:24:32.395
Speaker 0: to reflect that in return. Songs like 96,000

01:24:35.995
Speaker 0: get this gorgeous school sequence that feels straight

01:24:38.449
Speaker 0: out of classic cinema. Carnaval del Barrio gets

01:24:41.489
Speaker 0: long extended moments where the dancers simply get

01:24:44.050
Speaker 0: to play around and show off different dance

01:24:46.050
Speaker 0: styles strills from different countries. The opening number

01:24:48.975
Speaker 0: has a bunch of citizens in the ensemble

01:24:50.975
Speaker 0: out in the street. It can have these

01:24:52.975
Speaker 0: larger than life moments, easier than Evan Hansen

01:24:55.775
Speaker 0: can, and and it takes full advantage of

01:24:58.130
Speaker 0: that. But that being said, there are still

01:25:00.050
Speaker 0: moments where Heights chills down and creates simpler

01:25:02.610
Speaker 0: sequences. St. Nomadiga is a festive and cheery

01:25:05.475
Speaker 0: number led by the closest thing the show

01:25:07.555
Speaker 0: has to comic reliefs, but something that stands

01:25:09.715
Speaker 0: out when you watch that part of the

01:25:11.190
Speaker 0: movie is just how deliberate everything on screen

01:25:13.750
Speaker 0: is. The simple act of walking across the

01:25:16.230
Speaker 0: salon and sitting on a chair manages to

01:25:18.469
Speaker 0: keep the energy of the stre- with well

01:25:20.985
Speaker 0: timed cuts that keep up the pace without

01:25:22.985
Speaker 0: being obnoxious and well defined movements from the

01:25:25.545
Speaker 0: performers. There's not much here that's too elaborate,

01:25:28.990
Speaker 0: when you get past the synced up movements

01:25:30.670
Speaker 0: of the ensembles and the mannequin heads in

01:25:32.510
Speaker 0: the back, but it still manages to feel

01:25:34.350
Speaker 0: interesting because the shots are interesting and the

01:25:36.590
Speaker 0: performers are making clear, defined, and engaging choices.

01:25:40.465
Speaker 0: But, okay. Nomediga is still a more high

01:25:43.185
Speaker 0: energy song than most of the ones in

01:25:45.210
Speaker 0: Hansen. I wouldn't necessarily [object, nor would I

01:25:48.010
Speaker 0: want, things like entire movable sets or weird

01:25:50.650
Speaker 0: mannequin heads anywhere in Evan Hansen. With that

01:25:53.370
Speaker 0: in mind, let's instead look at Breathe, one

01:25:55.844
Speaker 0: of the downbeat songs from In the Heights,

01:25:57.685
Speaker 0: and basically the play's first I Want song.

01:26:01.045
Speaker 0: Breathe is a slow Str- Oh and Melancholy's

01:26:03.210
Speaker 0: Song About Nina, a young woman reflecting on

01:26:05.610
Speaker 0: her own anxieties and feelings of failure after

01:26:08.170
Speaker 0: struggling through her 1st year of College and

01:26:10.165
Speaker 0: coming back home. To convey this on film,

01:26:12.725
Speaker 0: Nina is walking through the streets solemnly, seemingly

01:26:16.005
Speaker 0: aimlessly, observing those around her and reflecting on

01:26:19.220
Speaker 0: her own past life. Once again, we have

01:26:21.860
Speaker 0: a number without much that would be super

01:26:23.780
Speaker 0: demanding for our lead performer. The other people

01:26:26.420
Speaker 0: in the neighbourhood do get more elaborate things

01:26:28.635
Speaker 0: to do, but even then, the dances they

01:26:30.394
Speaker 0: do are slower, meant less for show, and

01:26:32.474
Speaker 0: more to replicate the type of dancing you

01:26:34.394
Speaker 0: might see from older Striples dancing and remembering

01:26:37.170
Speaker 0: their own joy. It contrasts against Nina's feeling

01:26:40.210
Speaker 0: of aimlessness and her sadness. The end result

01:26:42.850
Speaker 0: is that despite this number being so downbeat

01:26:45.489
Speaker 0: and depressing, you're able to understand how Nina

01:26:48.355
Speaker 0: feels directionless while still getting something that works

01:26:51.074
Speaker 0: as a scene and maintains an energy and

01:26:53.315
Speaker 0: structure to it that benefits the music. Stre-

01:26:55.920
Speaker 0: Now let's compare this to how they shot

01:26:58.000
Speaker 0: Dear Evan Hansen's I Want song waving through

01:27:00.080
Speaker 0: a window because good fucking lord, where to

01:27:02.935
Speaker 0: stream. So the song opens the movie and

01:27:04.775
Speaker 0: lets you graciously know right away that you're

01:27:06.855
Speaker 0: in for a nightmare because this number basically

01:27:09.015
Speaker 0: does every sort of film musical sing you

01:27:11.735
Speaker 0: could St- You see, the first few minutes

01:27:14.410
Speaker 0: are honestly shot fine. Like, it's Evan singing

01:27:18.250
Speaker 0: to himself in a room. It's hard to

01:27:19.929
Speaker 0: fuck up. But then the editing goes into

01:27:22.295
Speaker 0: overdrive. There's so many cuts here that are

01:27:24.614
Speaker 0: super frantic and fast, including one on every

01:27:27.175
Speaker 0: time Evan says tap. I understand what they're

01:27:29.335
Speaker 0: doing They're trying to use editing to emulate

01:27:31.790
Speaker 0: what his anxiety feels like. But they did

01:27:34.590
Speaker 0: way too much. Like, you can't breathe. It's

01:27:37.365
Speaker 0: like you don't even wanna be around watching

01:27:39.365
Speaker 0: the movie anymore. I understand what they're going

01:27:41.845
Speaker 0: for, but it doesn't work. It's more funny

01:27:44.005
Speaker 0: than anything. We also get the next musical

01:27:46.870
Speaker 0: movie sing, which is overly literal interpretations of

01:27:49.830
Speaker 0: the lyrics. I get why this happens. Once

01:27:52.070
Speaker 0: again, you have that problem where on stage,

01:27:54.335
Speaker 0: you're allowed to have the actors just stand

01:27:56.415
Speaker 0: around and sing to the audience without worrying

01:27:58.495
Speaker 0: much about stage business or props or anything

01:28:01.535
Speaker 0: complex like that. And so it's easy to

01:28:04.139
Speaker 0: go through the lyrics and just match them

01:28:06.139
Speaker 0: up to what's going on. And in a

01:28:07.900
Speaker 0: lot of respects, it makes sense. Like, if

01:28:10.215
Speaker 0: St- Taylor Swift is singing about dancing in

01:28:12.375
Speaker 0: the kitchen around a refrigerator light, then yeah,

01:28:14.775
Speaker 0: you show her dancing in the kitchen around

01:28:16.614
Speaker 0: the refrigerator light. But goddamn, sometimes it can

01:28:19.619
Speaker 0: be really funny. One example of this was

01:28:21.940
Speaker 0: in the Les Mis movie in, A Little

01:28:23.780
Speaker 0: Fall of Rain. The point of that number

01:28:26.100
Speaker 0: is that She's just bleeding to death. She

01:28:27.695
Speaker 0: thinks it's raining because of the wet blood

01:28:29.535
Speaker 0: on her, but they just they just put

01:28:30.895
Speaker 0: a rain machine. Like, the first time when

01:28:33.135
Speaker 0: Evan sings waving through a window. He's actually

01:28:35.290
Speaker 0: looking through a window and then when he

01:28:36.970
Speaker 0: sings step out of the sun, he's actually

01:28:38.890
Speaker 0: stepping out of the car and into the

01:28:40.490
Speaker 0: sun. And it's like, these are metaphors. You

01:28:43.130
Speaker 0: realize these are metaphors. Stores, right? There was

01:28:45.005
Speaker 0: never an actual window. It's like those TikTok

01:28:48.285
Speaker 0: videos of people doing literal interpretations of no

01:28:51.405
Speaker 0: children except this is done seriously and by

01:28:54.300
Speaker 0: a studio that spent 1,000,000 of dollars on

01:28:56.540
Speaker 0: it.

01:28:57.180
Speaker 1: You are coming down with me

01:29:03.095
Speaker 0: Once Evan actually gets to the school, you

01:29:05.255
Speaker 0: run into the problem with how the extras

01:29:07.150
Speaker 0: are directed. Once again, much like the editing,

01:29:09.630
Speaker 0: I get what they're trying to do here.

01:29:11.550
Speaker 0: You see everyone else in school walking around

01:29:13.710
Speaker 0: Evan at their own pace, completely ignoring him

01:29:16.215
Speaker 0: and focusing solely on their own lives. It's

01:29:18.934
Speaker 0: supposed to emphasize Evan's isolation and anxiety when

01:29:21.735
Speaker 0: it comes to being around others. Strutches. But

01:29:23.830
Speaker 0: it's also done so fucking poorly because the

01:29:26.310
Speaker 0: extras are just wandering around with no real

01:29:28.870
Speaker 0: sense of rhythm, purpose, drive, anything. They don't

01:29:32.070
Speaker 0: need to be doing a Dance number or

01:29:33.675
Speaker 0: anything, but right now it feels like they

01:29:35.195
Speaker 0: just gave them no direction but walk and

01:29:37.595
Speaker 0: then rolled the camera. It just completely zaps

01:29:40.395
Speaker 0: the energy out of what should be the

01:29:42.060
Speaker 0: climax of the song. And it's not helped

01:29:44.699
Speaker 0: by the aforementioned weird cutting, which takes things

01:29:47.660
Speaker 0: either too on beat or weirdly off speed

01:29:50.165
Speaker 0: or just does the weird moment where the

01:29:51.605
Speaker 0: camera does a 360 arc shot around Evan

01:29:54.325
Speaker 0: but it keeps cutting and restarting where the

01:29:56.405
Speaker 0: previous cut started at. Once again, I do

01:29:59.190
Speaker 0: get that this is to emulate his anxiety.

01:30:01.830
Speaker 0: But it's doing so very poorly. When this

01:30:04.390
Speaker 0: is how you start your film out, I

01:30:05.990
Speaker 0: don't have any frame

01:30:06.498
Speaker 1: of reference as to what the film is

01:30:06.611
Speaker 1: going to

01:30:06.639
Speaker 0: look like when not in anxiety mode. As

01:30:07.835
Speaker 0: to what the film is going to look

01:30:09.435
Speaker 0: like when not in anxiety mode. It just

01:30:12.075
Speaker 0: looks bad. Also, what the fuck is with

01:30:14.875
Speaker 0: this guy not actually hitting his drum set.

01:30:17.760
Speaker 0: Backtracking a bit, there's a moment in this

01:30:19.679
Speaker 0: number where Evan is in the car as

01:30:21.440
Speaker 0: his mom drives him to school. This moment

01:30:23.760
Speaker 0: is small, but St- incredibly awkward. We have

01:30:27.195
Speaker 0: Evan singing his bit of the song while

01:30:29.115
Speaker 0: his mom is just there with him, existing

01:30:31.595
Speaker 0: in the same space but failing to acknowledge

01:30:33.755
Speaker 0: what he's doing or participating in it just

01:30:36.280
Speaker 0: gives him a playful and comforting rub on

01:30:38.360
Speaker 0: the shoulder, which weirdly makes it worse than

01:30:40.280
Speaker 0: if she didn't acknowledge him at all, at

01:30:42.415
Speaker 0: least then it could be seen as Evan

01:30:43.615
Speaker 0: existing in his own world, divorced from everyone

01:30:45.775
Speaker 0: else, but the way that it's done makes

01:30:47.615
Speaker 0: it super uncomfortable. This is an issue basically

01:30:51.000
Speaker 0: All the musical numbers in the film have.

01:30:53.560
Speaker 0: Once again, we're back in that last 5

01:30:55.719
Speaker 0: years problem. The more grounded and realistic you

01:30:58.600
Speaker 0: make your film adaptation, the more additional players

01:31:01.364
Speaker 0: you add to a scene, the weirder it's

01:31:03.445
Speaker 0: going to be to try and force your

01:31:05.045
Speaker 0: characters to interact in it. Dear Evan Hansen

01:31:07.605
Speaker 0: doesn't have as many solos as the last

01:31:09.470
Speaker 0: 5 years does, but it still manages to

01:31:11.310
Speaker 0: look just as awkward as that movie does

01:31:13.150
Speaker 0: with basically all of its musical numbers. It

01:31:15.865
Speaker 0: certainly doesn't help that the first song we

01:31:18.105
Speaker 0: get after Waving Through a Window is For

01:31:20.505
Speaker 0: Forever, another Evans solo song which as him

01:31:23.030
Speaker 0: passionately lying as he fondly talks about his

01:31:25.989
Speaker 0: friendship with Connor to Connor's family. Because this

01:31:28.910
Speaker 0: is a scene where only Evan sings, it's

01:31:31.324
Speaker 0: Ben Platt basically going off on a song

01:31:33.565
Speaker 0: where the people around him just have to

01:31:35.405
Speaker 0: stare and look and smile, with maybe Amy

01:31:38.364
Speaker 0: really needs a new agent Adams interjecting with

01:31:40.900
Speaker 0: dialogue here and there. And this is a

01:31:42.980
Speaker 0: 5 minute song, so you have to live

01:31:45.220
Speaker 0: in this space wanting to crawl under your

01:31:47.540
Speaker 0: chair from sheer discomfort St- for 5 whole

01:31:50.265
Speaker 0: minutes. The stage show is also like this.

01:31:53.145
Speaker 0: It's also Evans singing to a mostly silent

01:31:55.625
Speaker 0: table at the Murphy house. The difference is

01:31:57.945
Speaker 0: that the Stageshow doesn't make me feel like

01:31:59.890
Speaker 0: I'm actually in someone's dining room watching a

01:32:02.130
Speaker 0: kid sing out of nowhere. The overall direction

01:32:04.370
Speaker 0: of the movie is way too grounded, stre-

01:32:06.325
Speaker 0: Way too serious, way too realistic that whenever

01:32:08.765
Speaker 0: a sparse song does happen, it feels like

01:32:10.925
Speaker 0: a surprise and actually ruins the flow of

01:32:13.085
Speaker 0: the movie and just feels very uncomfortable. Then

01:32:14.685
Speaker 0: there's just some weirdly baffling choices. Stroll. Then

01:32:16.330
Speaker 0: there's just some weirdly baffling choices. Take the

01:32:20.490
Speaker 0: awkward semi love song If If I Could

01:32:22.705
Speaker 0: Tell Her, which is about Evan telling Zoey

01:32:24.865
Speaker 0: what he likes about her by pretending it

01:32:26.945
Speaker 0: was what Connor actually thought of her. It's

01:32:29.920
Speaker 0: A very strange song since it is written

01:32:31.920
Speaker 0: like a love song and it is supposed

01:32:33.600
Speaker 0: to be the first song to start their

01:32:35.040
Speaker 0: romance plot, but it is also, you know,

01:32:36.800
Speaker 0: being presented to Zooey as if it's her

01:32:38.880
Speaker 0: brother's thoughts about her. I wouldn't know exactly

01:32:42.125
Speaker 0: how to stage this either, but I definitely

01:32:44.364
Speaker 0: wouldn't do it the way the movie does

01:32:45.885
Speaker 0: it. In the stage show, they do it

01:32:47.880
Speaker 0: in a relatively simple and basic way. Evan

01:32:50.679
Speaker 0: is in Zoe's room, which in this case

01:32:52.360
Speaker 0: is basically just a bed and a shelf,

01:32:53.960
Speaker 0: and the 2 get talking, and Evan gets

01:32:56.485
Speaker 0: stroi until he's sitting on her bed and

01:32:58.485
Speaker 0: it ends with him stealing a kiss. It's

01:33:00.885
Speaker 0: simple, but it gets the job done. You

01:33:02.965
Speaker 0: see these 2 get more intimate as the

01:33:04.804
Speaker 0: song goes on, not just Str- emotional but

01:33:06.860
Speaker 0: literally closer in space until the final moments,

01:33:09.420
Speaker 0: and with this you see a gradual increase

01:33:11.820
Speaker 0: in Evan's confidence. But then the movie decides

01:33:15.025
Speaker 0: to put this in the Murphy's kitchen, with

01:33:17.345
Speaker 0: the majority of the action being Evan and

01:33:19.265
Speaker 0: Zooey across from each other as they circle

01:33:21.665
Speaker 0: around the Island Kitchen. And like, this is

01:33:24.780
Speaker 0: a very wild disregard for cinematic conventions because

01:33:28.219
Speaker 0: any time you've seen a guy and a

01:33:29.659
Speaker 0: girl circle around a kitchen island in film,

01:33:32.285
Speaker 0: It's in a scene where he wants to

01:33:33.965
Speaker 0: murder her and she's trying to figure out

01:33:35.965
Speaker 0: a way out. It makes a song that

01:33:37.965
Speaker 0: was mildly creepy evolve into something intensely creepy.

01:33:41.600
Speaker 0: Stree. And it's not helped by it also

01:33:43.600
Speaker 0: cutting to these flashbacks that show the old

01:33:45.840
Speaker 0: pasty Ben Platt watching Zooey from afar across

01:33:49.040
Speaker 0: the years while singing about how much he

01:33:50.960
Speaker 0: loves str- her, which just really really increases

01:33:53.935
Speaker 0: the stalker vibes. Both the distance and the

01:33:56.895
Speaker 0: flashbacks ruin the sense of intimacy these 2

01:33:59.330
Speaker 0: you're supposed to have, as they spend most

01:34:01.170
Speaker 0: of the song really far away from each

01:34:03.170
Speaker 0: other. It cuts to flashback, and then they're

01:34:05.170
Speaker 0: both sitting on the couch right next to

01:34:06.930
Speaker 0: each Struthers, the moments where the 2 sit

01:34:08.805
Speaker 0: beside one another lost and obscured through the

01:34:11.285
Speaker 0: edit. It just really really isn't good. There's

01:34:14.565
Speaker 0: also just some minorly buck Wild Things. Like

01:34:17.420
Speaker 0: for some reason having Zoey in Requiem speed

01:34:19.659
Speaker 0: up a car and then come to a

01:34:21.099
Speaker 0: super abrupt stop, which was just not needed

01:34:23.340
Speaker 0: at all. Super super overkill St- That moment

01:34:27.515
Speaker 0: in You Will Be Found where they realized

01:34:29.435
Speaker 0: they need to explain why Evan's speech was

01:34:31.890
Speaker 0: stre- filmed so they have him mess up

01:34:33.570
Speaker 0: and kids laugh at him and take out

01:34:35.410
Speaker 0: their phones to record his embarrassment. Which is

01:34:38.130
Speaker 0: just wild to me. Stream. Like, imagine if

01:34:40.905
Speaker 0: his speech did end up sucking and he

01:34:42.905
Speaker 0: wasn't able to turn it around. What would

01:34:44.985
Speaker 0: they do with that upload? Post it to

01:34:47.065
Speaker 0: r slash Strings with the title, teenager drops

01:34:50.360
Speaker 0: his cue cards at suicide memorial for his

01:34:53.080
Speaker 0: best friend. Thankfully, Evan didn't mess up his

01:34:55.845
Speaker 0: Street, so they instead uploaded it with the

01:34:57.765
Speaker 0: title, his best friend died. You won't believe

01:35:00.725
Speaker 0: what he did next, which is the real

01:35:02.405
Speaker 0: title that they put in the stri- movie

01:35:04.420
Speaker 0: for the really sad emotional scene, I shit

01:35:06.580
Speaker 0: you not. Fucking choices. When this movie isn't

01:35:09.620
Speaker 0: making the worst choices possible, it's making the

01:35:12.020
Speaker 0: most boring ones. Streams. This film has a

01:35:14.455
Speaker 0: tendency to really really go all in on

01:35:16.935
Speaker 0: shot reverse shots, both in its musical numbers

01:35:19.415
Speaker 0: and also just in general. There are so

01:35:21.969
Speaker 0: many scenes that are just these long, static

01:35:24.369
Speaker 0: medium shots of the actors swapping back and

01:35:26.849
Speaker 0: forth with no other interesting camera choices or

01:35:29.815
Speaker 0: stage movements or anything. This can be seen

01:35:32.615
Speaker 0: in scenes like the new song The Anonymous

01:35:34.615
Speaker 0: Ones, but can especially be felt in the

01:35:36.455
Speaker 0: way they shot Only Us. For context, this

01:35:39.140
Speaker 0: is the song where Zoe and Evan get

01:35:40.740
Speaker 0: together, with Zoe expressing her love for Evan

01:35:43.060
Speaker 0: and her desire to progress the relationship beyond

01:35:45.620
Speaker 0: bonding over her dead brother. It's the closest

01:35:48.165
Speaker 0: thing Dear Evan Hansen has to a romantic

01:35:50.405
Speaker 0: song, once you ignore all the, you know,

01:35:52.245
Speaker 0: other stuff that might make it weird. And

01:35:54.165
Speaker 0: the movie decides to showcase these to growing

01:35:56.500
Speaker 0: closer by mainly showing them separated in their

01:35:59.620
Speaker 0: own frames, away from each other and across

01:36:01.940
Speaker 0: the room. I'm not sure exactly why the

01:36:04.420
Speaker 0: film does this so so often. If I

01:36:06.415
Speaker 0: had to guess, it could be because they

01:36:08.015
Speaker 0: just struggled to figure out exactly how to

01:36:10.175
Speaker 0: choreograph and frame a lot of these numbers

01:36:12.175
Speaker 0: and just defaulting to the most basic option.

01:36:14.760
Speaker 0: But another potential possibility is that it is

01:36:17.400
Speaker 0: this way because of covid restrictions, as yes,

01:36:19.800
Speaker 0: they did film this movie during the height

01:36:21.559
Speaker 0: of the pandemic, which means every shot you

01:36:23.559
Speaker 0: see on screen is putting someone's life at

01:36:25.555
Speaker 0: risk. So that's something. And would explain why

01:36:29.395
Speaker 0: they really try to keep everyone 6 feet

01:36:31.395
Speaker 0: apart and in their own frames. There are

01:36:33.780
Speaker 0: Some good moments that I will give credit

01:36:35.380
Speaker 0: for. Sincerely Me, while still overall not great,

01:36:38.580
Speaker 0: especially toward the end with the random fucking

01:36:40.660
Speaker 0: go karts and shit, manages to be the

01:36:42.340
Speaker 0: best number in Film by actually doing dancing.

01:36:45.405
Speaker 0: Starting off with a fun single take shot

01:36:47.324
Speaker 0: and just generally feeling more structured and elaborate

01:36:49.965
Speaker 0: than the rest of the numbers. It really

01:36:52.139
Speaker 0: feels like they put a lot more focus

01:36:53.900
Speaker 0: here than they did with the others. There's

01:36:55.900
Speaker 0: also some bit of cinematography I like. I

01:36:58.380
Speaker 0: know I ragged on For forever, but I

01:37:00.185
Speaker 0: do think it's neat how the song basically

01:37:02.025
Speaker 0: ends by framing Evan on his own by

01:37:04.264
Speaker 0: the window, Connor's parents on their own, and

01:37:06.344
Speaker 0: then Zoe getting the frame to herself as

01:37:08.425
Speaker 0: they look at Evan. It shows the divide,

01:37:11.100
Speaker 0: how the parents are fully buying into Evan

01:37:13.420
Speaker 0: while Zoe is reluctant and distant from the

01:37:15.820
Speaker 0: others. But what makes me really like it

01:37:17.875
Speaker 0: is toward the end, during words fail, when

01:37:20.034
Speaker 0: we find ourselves back in the dining room

01:37:21.795
Speaker 0: with Evan once again toward the window, but

01:37:24.034
Speaker 0: this time with Zoe and her parents St-

01:37:26.310
Speaker 0: across from him, sharing the frame, showing how

01:37:29.030
Speaker 0: united they are in this moment in their

01:37:31.110
Speaker 0: disgust toward this fucking kid. It's like the

01:37:33.830
Speaker 0: one standout time of the cinematography actually doing

01:37:37.245
Speaker 0: a good job expressing how the characters feel

01:37:39.805
Speaker 0: through framing. As a whole, Dear Evan Hansen's

01:37:42.580
Speaker 0: directing is just not good. It fails to

01:37:45.860
Speaker 0: understand how to best elevate the material, how

01:37:48.100
Speaker 0: to translate the work to stage, and how

01:37:49.860
Speaker 0: to make the most out of the musical

01:37:51.380
Speaker 0: numbers. I I mean, beyond just looking at

01:37:53.195
Speaker 0: individual scenes, the film itself has an overall

01:37:55.915
Speaker 0: problem with its tone and direction that bring

01:37:57.995
Speaker 0: it down hard. Part of the problem with

01:38:00.450
Speaker 0: doing the thing where you get these award

01:38:02.290
Speaker 0: aspiring directors to make a film aimed primarily

01:38:04.930
Speaker 0: to garner critical acclaim and award recognition, and

01:38:07.490
Speaker 0: in my opinion Dear Evan Hansen is 100%

01:38:10.034
Speaker 0: an award bait movie, is that they're going

01:38:11.955
Speaker 0: to do what they can to emphasize the

01:38:13.795
Speaker 0: aspects of the project they feel will get

01:38:15.554
Speaker 0: it nominated for an award. St- As said

01:38:17.860
Speaker 0: before, this usually means trying their best to

01:38:20.100
Speaker 0: ground it to a sense of realism, one

01:38:21.860
Speaker 0: that's not necessarily gritty, but is raw. And

01:38:24.580
Speaker 0: not only does Dear Evan Hansen do this,

01:38:26.645
Speaker 0: but it also comes with the extra benefit

01:38:28.565
Speaker 0: of just sapping basically every ounce of comedy

01:38:31.364
Speaker 0: out of the scene and really playing up

01:38:33.285
Speaker 0: the emotions of everyone at all times. Basically

01:38:36.630
Speaker 0: every scene, every performance is shot and performed

01:38:39.750
Speaker 0: like they want you to cry. That you're

01:38:41.750
Speaker 0: supposed to be moved by how profound it

01:38:43.750
Speaker 0: is. I was honestly shocked that they didn't

01:39:21.085
Speaker 0: just slap a for your consideration banner on

01:39:23.565
Speaker 0: the entire movie. The weird thing about is

01:39:26.060
Speaker 0: that the stage show is a dark comedy.

01:39:28.780
Speaker 0: Like, it doesn't go all in on the

01:39:30.300
Speaker 0: dark comedy angle the same way similar works

01:39:32.675
Speaker 0: like, say, World's Greatest Dad do, but it

01:39:34.994
Speaker 0: was still funny when it needed to be.

01:39:36.755
Speaker 0: It made sure to have a punchline, to

01:39:38.514
Speaker 0: have comedic beats, to have moments that broke

01:39:40.890
Speaker 0: up the tension. I mean, the reason why

01:39:43.210
Speaker 0: Sincerely Me is basically the fan favourite number

01:39:46.170
Speaker 0: is because it goes all in on the

01:39:47.850
Speaker 0: dark comedy aspect in a way the rest

01:39:49.915
Speaker 0: of the songs don't. And despite the movie

01:39:52.475
Speaker 0: maintaining this song, it basically drops every other

01:39:55.275
Speaker 0: instance Strick Humour. It's like the filmmakers saw

01:39:58.040
Speaker 0: the way certain parts of the fandom view

01:40:00.199
Speaker 0: Dear Evan Hansen as this sincere, heartfelt, tearjerker

01:40:02.943
Speaker 0: play about mental health

01:40:03.034
Speaker 1: and decided to go all in on it.

01:40:03.217
Speaker 1: I mean, look at the way

01:40:03.354
Speaker 0: the marketing focused so

01:40:06.645
Speaker 1: Str- I decided to go all in on

01:40:06.858
Speaker 1: it.

01:40:06.885
Speaker 0: I mean, look at the way the marketing

01:40:08.405
Speaker 0: focused so heavily on You Will Be Found.

01:40:10.965
Speaker 0: The song that's supposed to be a double

01:40:12.805
Speaker 0: entendre about how Stream- Evan is going to

01:40:14.710
Speaker 0: inevitably be revealed as a liar, he'll be

01:40:17.190
Speaker 0: found, and used it completely sincerely as a

01:40:19.990
Speaker 0: song about mental health. And every single interview

01:40:22.550
Speaker 0: and piece of promotional material is about the

01:40:24.855
Speaker 0: emotional impact of the story and how important

01:40:27.655
Speaker 0: and meaningful it all is, and it's so

01:40:30.135
Speaker 0: not the right way to go about about

01:40:32.070
Speaker 0: this. I'm not just saying this because I

01:40:33.750
Speaker 0: think that movies should have more quips or

01:40:35.989
Speaker 0: something. I'm not Joss Whedon. I'm fine with

01:40:38.469
Speaker 0: a serious introspective film that tries to do

01:40:41.135
Speaker 0: something emotional. And I can understand why, from

01:40:43.695
Speaker 0: their perspective, they might have thought that removing

01:40:45.775
Speaker 0: the comedy would show more respect for the

01:40:47.855
Speaker 0: subject matter and come off as less tasteless.

01:40:50.540
Speaker 0: Stream list. But weirdly enough, it comes off

01:40:53.020
Speaker 0: as more so? When you have those darkly

01:40:55.980
Speaker 0: comedic elements, you're allowed to get away with

01:40:57.980
Speaker 0: things you St- probably wouldn't have otherwise. Dear

01:41:00.775
Speaker 0: Evan Hansen is a show with a deeply

01:41:02.775
Speaker 0: intense subject matter and a very complicated main

01:41:05.494
Speaker 0: character. The presence of jokes and humour in

01:41:07.974
Speaker 0: the stage show show act as a sort

01:41:09.610
Speaker 0: of acknowledgment of that fact. It's the show

01:41:12.090
Speaker 0: giving a wink toward the audience, letting us

01:41:14.409
Speaker 0: know that it understands the absurdity and potential

01:41:17.765
Speaker 0: tastelessness of what the characters are doing. And

01:41:20.485
Speaker 0: more importantly, it makes Evan more charming and

01:41:23.045
Speaker 0: relatable and human. By showing him engaging in

01:41:26.005
Speaker 0: conversations with others, Sturm allowing himself to be

01:41:28.429
Speaker 0: funny and tell jokes and have moments that

01:41:30.510
Speaker 0: are played for soft laughs, we can gain

01:41:32.909
Speaker 0: more sympathy for him throughout the show and

01:41:35.070
Speaker 0: see him more as a Stream. In the

01:41:38.155
Speaker 0: movie, though, where everything is played so dry

01:41:41.115
Speaker 0: and seriously, you have no choice but to

01:41:43.195
Speaker 0: examine the implications of everything going on. Without

01:41:46.850
Speaker 0: Evan's awkward banter with Zooey played for laughs,

01:41:49.810
Speaker 0: the film forces you to think about how

01:41:51.810
Speaker 0: creepy their relationship actually is, with the school's

01:41:55.465
Speaker 0: sad reaction to Connor's death played almost completely

01:41:58.585
Speaker 0: seriously, you have no choice but to think

01:42:01.065
Speaker 0: about how little the play is actually about

01:42:03.625
Speaker 0: him and how fucked up it is to

01:42:05.390
Speaker 0: use a teenager's suicide purely as a plot

01:42:08.190
Speaker 0: device without actually fundamentally exploring the implication. And

01:42:12.324
Speaker 0: without the charm Ben Platt could give Evan

01:42:14.405
Speaker 0: on stage, your mind is eventually going to

01:42:16.565
Speaker 0: drift off into examining how the film strictly

01:42:19.340
Speaker 0: does explore his mental health issues, and mental

01:42:21.420
Speaker 0: health in general, and whether or not it

01:42:23.260
Speaker 0: actually covers the subject well. I think this

01:42:25.820
Speaker 0: is stri- Big reason why critical reaction to

01:42:28.219
Speaker 0: the movie has been significantly worse than that

01:42:30.715
Speaker 0: of the musical. Beyond Ben Platt's age, beyond

01:42:33.212
Speaker 0: the musical numbers not being very good or

01:42:35.708
Speaker 0: well directed, the drastic tonal shift honestly makes

01:42:38.900
Speaker 0: the material so much worse. By trying to

01:42:41.780
Speaker 0: make the work deeper, they essentially forced critics

01:42:44.580
Speaker 0: to dig into it Stream, which meant the

01:42:46.275
Speaker 0: work being basically exposed and torn apart in

01:42:48.915
Speaker 0: ways it really hadn't before. Or at least

01:42:51.155
Speaker 0: that's how it felt to me because god

01:42:52.995
Speaker 0: the movie feels so much worse. So so

01:42:55.510
Speaker 0: much worse. Musical movies are very hard to

01:42:58.710
Speaker 0: do. Sometimes they can elevate the original work,

01:43:01.590
Speaker 0: like How Chicago managed to become more interesting

01:43:04.155
Speaker 0: than its stage counterpart by changing the musical

01:43:06.635
Speaker 0: numbers into these explicit dream sequences representing what's

01:43:09.960
Speaker 0: going on in the real world. And as

01:43:11.800
Speaker 0: fun as ways to get a musical number

01:43:13.400
Speaker 0: to make sense on film go, saying it

01:43:15.400
Speaker 0: takes place on a fictional stage in a

01:43:17.455
Speaker 0: St- Cabaret representing someone's psyche is as good

01:43:20.255
Speaker 0: of a method as any. God, I love

01:43:22.335
Speaker 0: how they do the scene where that one

01:43:23.855
Speaker 0: lady gets hanged. It's so fucking good. And

01:43:26.530
Speaker 0: sometimes musical films can be done just as

01:43:28.450
Speaker 0: well as their stage counterparts. Films like Little

01:43:31.250
Speaker 0: Shop of Horrors, Cabaret, Rocky Street Horror Picture

01:43:33.865
Speaker 0: Show, and even Hairspray managed to translate what

01:43:36.425
Speaker 0: worked on the theatrical show to screen and

01:43:38.585
Speaker 0: are overall enjoyable experiences in their own Right.

01:43:42.119
Speaker 0: And sometimes you have Cats, which exists in

01:43:44.199
Speaker 0: a tier all on its own, away from

01:43:45.880
Speaker 0: any sort of judgment beyond our mortal comprehension.

01:43:48.440
Speaker 0: And then you have the bad ones, the

01:43:50.280
Speaker 0: ones that really miss the mark. You're Les

01:43:52.715
Speaker 0: Mis, you're Phantom, you're Into the Woods, which

01:43:54.875
Speaker 0: aren't just bad films but actively seem to

01:43:57.114
Speaker 0: misunderstand and work against the appeal of the

01:43:59.915
Speaker 0: original Sturgeon. Dear Evan Hansen falls into that

01:44:03.070
Speaker 0: category, as do a lot of musical films,

01:44:05.309
Speaker 0: unfortunately. And the thing that sucks is that

01:44:07.550
Speaker 0: for a lot of shows, Film adaptations like

01:44:10.105
Speaker 0: these are the only way that most people

01:44:12.184
Speaker 0: can experience them. Meaning that a lot of

01:44:14.505
Speaker 0: the times, if you want to experience a

01:44:16.344
Speaker 0: show you like in ways other than just

01:44:18.050
Speaker 0: Stream listening to the cast recording, you're left

01:44:20.210
Speaker 0: with little option but to watch a subpar

01:44:22.610
Speaker 0: screen adaptation. But what if there were other

01:44:26.210
Speaker 0: options? So for the longest time, it seemed

01:44:33.835
Speaker 0: like there was a clear path for the

01:44:35.514
Speaker 0: life of a musical. It runs on stage,

01:44:37.960
Speaker 0: and then if the producers decide that it's

01:44:39.719
Speaker 0: run for enough time that ticket sales won't

01:44:41.719
Speaker 0: be affected by a non theater version, they

01:44:43.880
Speaker 0: begin optioning off the project for potential adaptations,

01:44:47.145
Speaker 0: meaning that those at home can finally experience

01:44:49.385
Speaker 0: Phantom of the Opera almost 20 years after

01:44:51.625
Speaker 0: it debuted on Broadway. And if the Phantom

01:44:53.864
Speaker 0: movie sucks, well, sorry. Guess we'll just have

01:44:56.670
Speaker 0: to go grab tickets to a live performance.

01:44:58.910
Speaker 0: However, this has changed a bit recently. I

01:45:01.310
Speaker 0: did a whole other video on this, but

01:45:03.310
Speaker 0: this increased demand and for musicals and the

01:45:05.345
Speaker 0: nature of the Internet has created an entire

01:45:07.425
Speaker 0: platform for the distribution of musical bootlegs, illegal

01:45:10.545
Speaker 0: recordings of shows that are later posted online.

01:45:13.170
Speaker 0: This dramatically changes the way in which we

01:45:15.250
Speaker 0: look at these film adaptations. Before the Internet,

01:45:18.130
Speaker 0: musical bootlegs weren't necessarily impossible, but they were

01:45:21.090
Speaker 0: a lot harder to just stumble across. But

01:45:23.675
Speaker 0: now, if you wanna find a bootleg of

01:45:25.355
Speaker 0: a show, you can just Google that show,

01:45:27.515
Speaker 0: and chances are you can find it pretty

01:45:29.355
Speaker 0: easily. Strictly. Not that I would condone such

01:45:31.469
Speaker 0: a thing, but I'm just saying that tryna

01:45:34.110
Speaker 0: say you need a film adaptation of Dear

01:45:35.950
Speaker 0: Evan Hansen to immortalize Ben Platt's performance rings

01:45:39.125
Speaker 0: a bit hollow in a world where I

01:45:40.965
Speaker 0: can Google blue slime tutorial and find a

01:45:43.605
Speaker 0: video of the original Broadway cast. Stre- Bootlegs

01:45:46.430
Speaker 0: especially rose to greater prominence in 2020, as

01:45:49.470
Speaker 0: with the global worldwide panini shutting down theatres,

01:45:52.350
Speaker 0: they became the only way for people to

01:45:54.190
Speaker 0: consume shows during that time. And I don't

01:45:56.945
Speaker 0: have anything to prove this, but I personally

01:45:59.025
Speaker 0: think that this also affected the way theater

01:46:01.185
Speaker 0: companies viewed bootlegs. Beforehand, years ago, stre- Bootlegs

01:46:05.060
Speaker 0: and slime tutorials would get taken down super

01:46:07.620
Speaker 0: quickly and super easily. Someone would upload that

01:46:10.820
Speaker 0: 1 DVD fab Street leg of Hamilton, if

01:46:13.425
Speaker 0: you know the one, you know the one,

01:46:14.625
Speaker 0: and you only had a few hours to

01:46:16.305
Speaker 0: watch it before it was taken down. Same

01:46:18.865
Speaker 0: with Hades Town and Dear Evan Hansen and

01:46:21.440
Speaker 0: other big productions. But now there's just a

01:46:24.240
Speaker 0: plethora of bootlegs on YouTube with 100 of

01:46:27.200
Speaker 0: thousands of views that have been up for

01:46:28.965
Speaker 0: months, if not years. It definitely seems like

01:46:32.245
Speaker 0: the powers that be have gotten so much

01:46:34.485
Speaker 0: more relaxed about this sort of Struthing, which

01:46:36.360
Speaker 0: is nice because it opens a lot more

01:46:38.320
Speaker 0: opportunities for people to experience a lot more

01:46:40.880
Speaker 0: shows. Bootlegs aren't perfect. They generally

01:46:42.714
Speaker 1: have poor visual quality, sometimes the camera

01:46:42.886
Speaker 0: won't focus on the things St have poor

01:46:44.945
Speaker 0: visual quality, sometimes the camera won't focus on

01:46:47.665
Speaker 0: the things you want focused on, and sometimes

01:46:49.585
Speaker 0: you just can't see or hear what's going

01:46:51.585
Speaker 0: on well at St- all. But they can

01:46:53.520
Speaker 0: still be entertaining to watch and, in a

01:46:55.600
Speaker 0: lot of respects, are still better than a

01:46:57.760
Speaker 0: lot of the film counterparts. Like, I can

01:47:00.355
Speaker 0: honestly say that I preferred watching the camcorder

01:47:03.635
Speaker 0: bootleg of Dear Evan Hansen over the $3,000,000

01:47:06.995
Speaker 0: film adaptation. But if the visuals or questionable

01:47:10.410
Speaker 0: legality of bootlegs bothers you, that's fine and

01:47:13.450
Speaker 0: understandable. Watching a staged version of a show

01:47:16.170
Speaker 0: can be nice, but you might not like

01:47:17.850
Speaker 0: tracking down a version on an illicit st-

01:47:19.925
Speaker 0: source that's filmed on someone's potato? Well, that's

01:47:22.965
Speaker 0: where you get to one of the other

01:47:24.485
Speaker 0: more interesting recent developments: pro recordings. Professional recordings

01:47:28.690
Speaker 0: of stage shows aren't anything new. They've technically

01:47:31.489
Speaker 0: been around for a while. But they were

01:47:33.570
Speaker 0: generally pretty rare. Sure. Much like film adaptations,

01:47:36.355
Speaker 0: a lot of theatre companies don't want to

01:47:38.114
Speaker 0: have an outside version of the show that

01:47:39.954
Speaker 0: could potentially disincentivize someone from actually seeing it

01:47:42.994
Speaker 0: live. Stream. As such, pro recordings were generally

01:47:45.540
Speaker 0: only released for shows that had been going

01:47:47.460
Speaker 0: on for a while or that weren't going

01:47:49.300
Speaker 0: to be open for much longer. It took

01:47:51.355
Speaker 0: around 20 or so years for popular stage

01:47:53.915
Speaker 0: shows like Cats and Rent and Phantom of

01:47:56.075
Speaker 0: the Opera to finally get professional recordings. Strings.

01:47:59.420
Speaker 0: Although, pretty much every show has a proper

01:48:01.739
Speaker 0: camera recording of it. New York Public Library

01:48:04.460
Speaker 0: has access to it. It's just that most

01:48:06.139
Speaker 0: of us are not allowed to go in

01:48:07.545
Speaker 0: there and watch those things. Fun fact. That

01:48:10.585
Speaker 0: being said, pro recordings have their own unique

01:48:13.065
Speaker 0: problem. Part of the reason why you still

01:48:15.304
Speaker 0: saw

01:48:15.545
Speaker 1: film adaptations more than pro recordings is because

01:48:15.704
Speaker 1: for a while, there wasn't

01:48:15.804
Speaker 0: really a good way to Stations more than

01:48:17.020
Speaker 0: pro recordings is because for a while, there

01:48:19.100
Speaker 0: wasn't really a good way to distribute pro

01:48:21.100
Speaker 0: recordings, at least not in a way that

01:48:22.940
Speaker 0: would maximize St Profits. Recordings of live shows

01:48:25.575
Speaker 0: and concerts don't usually get theatrical runs, which

01:48:28.455
Speaker 0: meant for a while, the only method for

01:48:30.295
Speaker 0: releasing pro recordings was direct to VHS and

01:48:32.855
Speaker 0: direct to Studio. Which is fine. But, well,

01:48:36.870
Speaker 0: direct to home video stuff used to come

01:48:38.630
Speaker 0: with this stigma of being of lesser than

01:48:41.235
Speaker 0: theatrical counterparts. And it would almost certainly mean

01:48:44.195
Speaker 0: not making as much money. There was some

01:48:46.195
Speaker 0: hope that this could change, though. Back in

01:48:48.310
Speaker 0: 2016, renowned lip biter Lin Manuel Miranda made

01:48:51.430
Speaker 0: sure to get a full HD professional recording

01:48:53.910
Speaker 0: of Hamilton done with the original Broadway cast.

01:48:56.755
Speaker 0: The goal was to keep the recording in

01:48:58.355
Speaker 0: storage for a little while before debuting it

01:49:00.434
Speaker 0: to the public. And sure enough, the mouse

01:49:02.514
Speaker 0: himself, Disney, bought the rights to it for

01:49:04.434
Speaker 0: $75,000,000 stri- plans to give it a full

01:49:07.170
Speaker 0: theatrical release on October 15, 2021. And then,

01:49:10.610
Speaker 0: like, the world shut down. And so instead,

01:49:12.770
Speaker 0: it was retooled into a Disney plus exclusive,

01:49:15.355
Speaker 0: and its release pushed way way up to

01:49:17.514
Speaker 0: July 3, 2020. And it was a huge,

01:49:21.570
Speaker 0: Stream. Now, there's a lot of discourse about

01:49:23.969
Speaker 0: Hamilton, discourse that is banned from this channel

01:49:26.690
Speaker 0: because I do not wanna get into it.

01:49:28.210
Speaker 0: But I'll say this. Streams, the Hamilton pro

01:49:30.115
Speaker 0: recording does a very very good job replicating

01:49:33.075
Speaker 0: the energy of the stage show. Whatever you

01:49:35.395
Speaker 0: like about the stage show is basically stri-

01:49:37.430
Speaker 0: Still here. And if you like Hamilton, you'll

01:49:39.430
Speaker 0: like the pro recording. And if you've never

01:49:41.750
Speaker 0: experienced Hamilton, then you'll get a quality initial

01:49:44.645
Speaker 0: Stream experience with this. And most importantly, this

01:49:47.045
Speaker 0: thing was fucking massive. Streaming companies don't generally

01:49:50.885
Speaker 0: release viewer numbers, but going by estimates, Streams.

01:49:53.250
Speaker 0: Hamilton was viewed by around 22,000,000 people in

01:49:56.289
Speaker 0: its 1st month of release, which is a

01:49:58.449
Speaker 0: stupidly high number. It was the 2nd most

01:50:01.250
Speaker 0: watched straight to streaming titled that year, right

01:50:03.865
Speaker 0: behind Wonder Woman 1984. This is really interesting

01:50:07.465
Speaker 0: because it showed that, under the right circumstances,

01:50:10.105
Speaker 0: audiences are 100 Streams, willing to watch a

01:50:12.960
Speaker 0: recorded version of a stage show rather than

01:50:15.199
Speaker 0: a full film adaptation. Furthermore, it also showed

01:50:18.320
Speaker 0: that streaming platforms

01:50:18.719
Speaker 1: are a good place to distribute these sort

01:50:19.039
Speaker 1: of things.

01:50:19.119
Speaker 0: Much like the way streams are a good

01:50:20.265
Speaker 0: place to distribute these sort of things. Much

01:50:22.745
Speaker 0: like the way it's easy to stumble across

01:50:24.745
Speaker 0: and watch a musical on YouTube without much

01:50:27.065
Speaker 0: personal investment, people can stumble on shows they're

01:50:30.170
Speaker 0: curious about on a subscription streaming platform and

01:50:32.810
Speaker 0: watch them. And the demand for such things

01:50:35.210
Speaker 0: is there and huge. It's Difficult to say

01:50:37.865
Speaker 0: how Hamilton's streaming version's success will affect other

01:50:40.825
Speaker 0: productions going forward. Not all shows were lucky

01:50:43.705
Speaker 0: enough to have filmed a performance years before

01:50:45.865
Speaker 0: the lock down so there weren't a lot

01:50:47.300
Speaker 0: of immediate copycats trying to imitate its success.

01:50:50.579
Speaker 0: We have seen one, though. Before the pandemic,

01:50:53.139
Speaker 0: there were plans to adapt Come From Away

01:50:55.380
Speaker 0: into a feature film, which is just not

01:50:55.678
Speaker 1: a great idea if

01:50:55.828
Speaker 0: you've seen that show. Like, Stream, which is

01:50:57.114
Speaker 0: just not a great idea if you've seen

01:50:59.434
Speaker 0: that show. Like, a large part of its

01:51:01.034
Speaker 0: appeal is experimenting with the theatre format and

01:51:03.514
Speaker 0: its ensemble and the pacing and intensity of

01:51:05.880
Speaker 0: a live show. Once the pandemic happened, though,

01:51:08.200
Speaker 0: these plans basically evaporated as it was impossible

01:51:11.160
Speaker 0: to make any progress on the film version

01:51:13.160
Speaker 0: and interest in the project St dropped. However,

01:51:15.755
Speaker 0: upon seeing the success of Hamilton on Disney

01:51:18.315
Speaker 0: plus it was decided that instead of a

01:51:20.475
Speaker 0: film adaptation, they would instead change course and

01:51:23.200
Speaker 0: create a pro recording exclusively for Apple TV.

01:51:26.000
Speaker 0: And while I don't know how successful it

01:51:27.840
Speaker 0: was because, obviously, Come From Away is nowhere

01:51:30.320
Speaker 0: near as popular as Hamilton, I can say

01:51:32.425
Speaker 0: that the pro recording is pretty good and

01:51:34.585
Speaker 0: definitely worth a watch, and I'm pretty confident

01:51:36.985
Speaker 0: in saying that it's better than any film

01:51:38.824
Speaker 0: adaptation of the material would have Stream. It'll

01:51:41.200
Speaker 0: be interesting to see if more shows start

01:51:43.120
Speaker 0: doing this. There's a whole debate to be

01:51:45.040
Speaker 0: had about streaming exclusive content, and I know

01:51:47.600
Speaker 0: it can be annoying, but I would rather

01:51:49.345
Speaker 0: have, I don't know, Hulu get exclusive rights

01:51:51.345
Speaker 0: to a Hadestown pro recording than have to

01:51:53.505
Speaker 0: sit through a Universal Pictures film version. I

01:51:55.905
Speaker 0: think for a lot of shows, this method

01:51:57.579
Speaker 0: is a lot better and leads to a

01:51:59.179
Speaker 0: better quality product. And with Broadway's already existing

01:52:02.619
Speaker 0: issues with accessibility, I think this is a

01:52:04.699
Speaker 0: very good middle ground, Stroud, and I would

01:52:06.555
Speaker 0: love to see more pro recordings get released

01:52:08.795
Speaker 0: in the future. Dear Evan Hansen is bad.

01:52:13.250
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone here is gonna debate

01:52:15.010
Speaker 0: me on that, especially after watching 2 hours

01:52:17.090
Speaker 0: of me ramble about it. It's a dull,

01:52:19.330
Speaker 0: depressing, plotting mess of a movie that's uninteresting

01:52:22.369
Speaker 0: at best, st- Potentially tasteless at worst. But

01:52:25.295
Speaker 0: as I sat there and watched it and

01:52:26.735
Speaker 0: made fun of it with my cowriter Emily,

01:52:28.495
Speaker 0: I realized that Dear Evan Hansen itself isn't

01:52:31.295
Speaker 0: the problem. Rather, it's a symptom of a

01:52:34.170
Speaker 0: much worse disease. Musical movies are a strange

01:52:37.210
Speaker 0: art form, and one that's been in an

01:52:38.810
Speaker 0: awkward zone recently. After their resurgence to prominence

01:52:42.125
Speaker 0: in the early 2000s with Chicago and Moulin

01:52:44.445
Speaker 0: Rouge, it's been an up and down battle

01:52:46.205
Speaker 0: between films that understand Strand The Assignment and

01:52:48.929
Speaker 0: films that don't. And it's really interesting to

01:52:51.489
Speaker 0: me that a time where we're getting really

01:52:53.409
Speaker 0: good musical films like In the Street and

01:52:55.485
Speaker 0: Annette also gave us such films as Amazon

01:52:58.205
Speaker 0: Prime's Cinderella and Dear Evan Hansen. And considering

01:53:01.565
Speaker 0: how we're about to get things like West

01:53:03.405
Speaker 0: Side Story and the Wicked movie for real

01:53:05.469
Speaker 0: this time, it's tempting to look at exactly

01:53:07.789
Speaker 0: why certain musical adaptations do and don't work

01:53:10.590
Speaker 0: so you know whether or not to get

01:53:12.030
Speaker 0: your hopes up about the Wicked movie that's

01:53:13.855
Speaker 0: Stream. Happening certainly for real this time, guys.

01:53:16.735
Speaker 0: I went into this video with the simple

01:53:18.415
Speaker 0: mission statement of trashing Dear Evan Hansen because

01:53:21.135
Speaker 0: it's at an easily mockable movie. But the

01:53:23.860
Speaker 0: more I dug through it and the more

01:53:25.220
Speaker 0: I thought about it, the more I realized

01:53:26.820
Speaker 0: that my frustrations with Dear Evan Strandsen as

01:53:28.955
Speaker 0: a film don't come from a place of

01:53:30.795
Speaker 0: hate but out of love. I love musicals.

01:53:33.755
Speaker 0: I love them a lot. I think that

01:53:35.435
Speaker 0: they can be fun and incredibly compelling works

01:53:37.835
Speaker 0: of art that can entertain and enlighten. It's

01:53:40.619
Speaker 0: the combination of the art of music and

01:53:42.540
Speaker 0: the art of dance and the art of

01:53:44.139
Speaker 0: cinema into Streetful Amalgamation. And that's why it's

01:53:47.875
Speaker 0: so disappointing when that combination comes out looking

01:53:50.835
Speaker 0: more like a clusterfucked homunculus. Streams. During the

01:53:53.650
Speaker 0: writing process, after this script had already been

01:53:56.290
Speaker 0: mostly written, I learned the news that Stephen

01:53:58.690
Speaker 0: Sondheim had died. I don't know if you

01:54:00.610
Speaker 0: can tell, just on the absolute nerding out

01:54:02.795
Speaker 0: that happened in this video, but Into the

01:54:04.715
Speaker 0: Woods is my absolute favorite musical of all

01:54:07.115
Speaker 0: time. The characters, the musicality, the writing, The

01:54:10.260
Speaker 0: themes, everything about it resonates with me so

01:54:12.740
Speaker 0: hard, and so many people have that feeling

01:54:15.620
Speaker 0: with so many of Sondheim's works, all of

01:54:18.025
Speaker 0: which I honestly love. So much of what

01:54:20.105
Speaker 0: he's written has resonated with so many people,

01:54:22.665
Speaker 0: and it's all an absolutely incredible testament not

01:54:25.940
Speaker 0: only to what this man has created throughout

01:54:28.020
Speaker 0: his life, but also what he's created specifically

01:54:30.500
Speaker 0: within the medium of theatre. His work is

01:54:33.060
Speaker 0: some Broadway ass Broadway, and it's all such

01:54:35.885
Speaker 0: an incredible way of showcasing what you can

01:54:38.205
Speaker 0: do with musicals that you can't always do

01:54:40.365
Speaker 0: as effectively with other mediums. When I saw

01:54:43.120
Speaker 0: Sweeney Todd in, like, an off broadway stage

01:54:45.840
Speaker 0: they set up to be a pie shop,

01:54:47.520
Speaker 0: the characters walking and living and dying all

01:54:50.320
Speaker 0: around you and in the same space as

01:54:52.080
Speaker 0: you, I felt so pulled in and immersed

01:54:54.865
Speaker 0: in a way I've never quite experienced in

01:54:57.185
Speaker 0: another medium. When you listen to a song

01:54:59.585
Speaker 0: like Not Getting Married Today and you hear

01:55:01.745
Speaker 0: everyone St- sing at the same time, the

01:55:04.468
Speaker 0: different vocal styles and tempos and lyrics reflecting

01:55:06.934
Speaker 0: how their very discordant mental states come together,

01:55:09.400
Speaker 0: you feel so pulled in, not just by

01:55:11.866
Speaker 0: theatre, but by the fact that it's theater.

01:55:14.494
Speaker 0: This was never intended to be a Sondheim

01:55:16.494
Speaker 0: video, but honestly, so much of what Sondheim

01:55:19.215
Speaker 0: has put into the world of Theater is

01:55:20.960
Speaker 0: both a testament and a blessing to the

01:55:23.120
Speaker 0: very nature of the medium. It's hard to

01:55:25.040
Speaker 0: say what path movie musicals will take from

01:55:27.200
Speaker 0: this point on. The box office failures of

01:55:29.805
Speaker 0: Cats, Dear Evan Hansen, and Unfortunately In the

01:55:32.365
Speaker 0: Heights mixed with the absurd success of Hamilton's

01:55:34.925
Speaker 0: pro recording could lead to a drastic shift

01:55:37.240
Speaker 0: in how these projects get made and if

01:55:39.560
Speaker 0: we even get theatrical film adaptations at all.

01:55:42.360
Speaker 0: In a lot of respects, right now, a

01:55:44.120
Speaker 0: lot of hope is resting on West Side

01:55:45.880
Speaker 0: Story in Wicked to hopefully pick up that

01:55:47.985
Speaker 0: slack and prove that there's still an audience

01:55:50.065
Speaker 0: out there for the musical movie. It's a

01:55:52.385
Speaker 0: format that has promise, and as we've seen

01:55:54.945
Speaker 0: throughout some of the examples in Studio can

01:55:57.250
Speaker 0: be done well, on rare occasions, even in

01:55:59.410
Speaker 0: ways that are better or more interesting than

01:56:01.490
Speaker 0: their stage counterparts. But these films are so

01:56:04.290
Speaker 0: often made without a true understanding of what

01:56:06.775
Speaker 0: a musical is and what it should be

01:56:08.775
Speaker 0: and what parts of it can be altered

01:56:10.535
Speaker 0: to still create an interesting piece of art.

01:56:13.015
Speaker 0: One of the things we see a lot

01:56:14.215
Speaker 0: with projects like the Dear Evan Hansen St-

01:56:16.290
Speaker 0: is a rejection of what makes musicals musicals.

01:56:19.489
Speaker 0: Of strong choreography, of emotionally explosive musical numbers,

01:56:23.250
Speaker 0: of line delivery that's Live and a little

01:56:25.545
Speaker 0: bit exaggerated. And as someone who loves the

01:56:28.025
Speaker 0: things that make up what a musical is,

01:56:30.105
Speaker 0: that's a little sad to see. And that's

01:56:32.185
Speaker 0: why, honestly, if the rise of professionally shot

01:56:34.650
Speaker 0: Stage Musicals does indeed end up overshadowing the

01:56:37.290
Speaker 0: current trend of film adaptations, I'm gonna be

01:56:40.090
Speaker 0: pretty okay with that. In all fairness, though,

01:56:42.329
Speaker 0: the real reason for that has nothing to

01:56:43.849
Speaker 0: do with Anything I've said over the past,

01:56:45.554
Speaker 0: like, 2 hours, the real reason is that

01:56:47.315
Speaker 0: in this hypothetical future, we may never again

01:56:49.715
Speaker 0: have to see a movie musical that has

01:56:51.474
Speaker 0: James Cord in it. In case you couldn't

01:56:53.780
Speaker 0: tell, one of my favourite things is looking

01:56:55.860
Speaker 0: at random pieces of media and trying to

01:56:57.940
Speaker 0: work out what sort of storytelling lessons we

01:57:00.180
Speaker 0: might be able to take away from Stream,

01:57:02.115
Speaker 0: even ones we didn't necessarily expect. In this

01:57:04.835
Speaker 0: video, I didn't just wanna talk about Dear

01:57:06.835
Speaker 0: Evan Hansen so much as use it as

01:57:08.435
Speaker 0: a case study for the medium of musicals

01:57:10.435
Speaker 0: in general. And if you enjoyed me doing

01:57:12.350
Speaker 0: that, you might enjoy Debater Theatre, a special

01:57:14.670
Speaker 0: video I've made that is exclusive to Nebula.

01:57:17.310
Speaker 0: Nebula is Essentially a collaborative streaming platform by

01:57:20.485
Speaker 0: me and a bunch of other creators you

01:57:22.245
Speaker 0: might know and like. People like Big Joel

01:57:24.405
Speaker 0: or Lindsay Ellis or Fdsignifier or Terrible Writing

01:57:27.445
Speaker 0: Advice or even, just recently, my cowriter Emily.

01:57:31.260
Speaker 0: For one, it lets us make videos that

01:57:33.420
Speaker 0: might not be best suited for YouTube. Like,

01:57:35.740
Speaker 0: I was very worried making this one because

01:57:37.675
Speaker 0: because it touches on themes of mental health,

01:57:39.435
Speaker 0: which automatically makes me worry about stuff like

01:57:41.595
Speaker 0: monetization. With Nebula, you're able to see a

01:57:44.075
Speaker 0: lot of content that wouldn't necessarily make its

01:57:46.315
Speaker 0: way onto YouTube. So So not only are

01:57:48.270
Speaker 0: you able to watch all our videos early

01:57:50.190
Speaker 0: and without ads or sponsor segments on Nebula,

01:57:52.510
Speaker 0: but you also get access to Nebula Originals,

01:57:55.335
Speaker 0: Streams, exclusive videos that you can only find

01:57:57.335
Speaker 0: on that platform. So for example, for me,

01:57:59.655
Speaker 0: Debater Theatre is a video I made where

01:58:01.655
Speaker 0: I talk about learning to become a more

01:58:03.655
Speaker 0: persuasive person, and I do it by showing

01:58:05.960
Speaker 0: you that debate and persuasive rhetoric exists all

01:58:08.679
Speaker 0: around us, from movies to commercials to even

01:58:11.800
Speaker 0: award acceptance speeches. But you can also find

01:58:14.905
Speaker 0: And tons of other Nebula Originals on the

01:58:17.065
Speaker 0: platform by creators you hopefully love. Nebula has

01:58:20.825
Speaker 0: also partnered with Curiosity Stream, a really cool

01:58:23.780
Speaker 0: streaming service that has thousands of absolutely fascinating

01:58:27.300
Speaker 0: documentaries about things like science, History, Nature, and

01:58:31.475
Speaker 0: Technology, and it's incredibly cool. If you're interested

01:58:35.235
Speaker 0: in theatre, like me, there's this great TV

01:58:37.315
Speaker 0: program on there called Can a Computer Write

01:58:39.475
Speaker 0: a Hit Musical that's all about what artificial

01:58:41.830
Speaker 0: intelligence means and how it relates to human

01:58:44.230
Speaker 0: creativity. It also has a lot of St-

01:58:47.085
Speaker 0: Love for Musicals and how it can resonate

01:58:49.005
Speaker 0: with people baked into it, which I honestly

01:58:50.845
Speaker 0: think is just really amazing. If you wanna
